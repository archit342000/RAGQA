# Sample Documents

Lightweight fixtures for manual testing:

- `simple_text.pdf` – 2-page text-heavy PDF that validates the pypdf path.
- `two_column.pdf` – 2-page columnar layout that should trigger the unstructured fallback.
- `simple.txt` – UTF-8 text sample for the plain text parser.

The repository now ships minimal fixtures generated with reportlab so you can
exercise the pipeline end-to-end without additional setup.

I graduated from college, landed a job\nat a sort-of-big general contractor outfit, and with my older brother taking\ncare of our parents for me, I was currently enjoying all the myriad benefits\nof the bachelor-pad life. Age thirty-seven. No significant other.\nI wasn’t exactly short or frumpy or hideous or anything. But when it\ncame to the opposite sex, apparently I had nothing to offer. I’d made efforts\nalong those lines, with varying degrees of dedication, but by the third\nrejection, something fizzled out within me. Besides—really, at this age, I\nwas kinda past the point where a girlfriend needed to be my main focus.\nWork kept me busy enough. Plus, it wasn’t like I was gonna die without\none.\n…I’m not making excuses, all right? It’s just that I started thinking…\n“Oh, hello, sir! Sorry we’re late!”\nThere he was, walking toward me, bursting with all that youthful energy\nof his. He and the beautiful woman next to him. His name was Tamura, one\nof the guys who worked under me, and she was Sawatari, the front-desk\nlady and pretty much the “it” girl around the office.\nThese bums asked to see me because they were getting married and\nwanted my advice. In other words, this meeting was the whole reason I was\nbrooding over why I was such a failure at personal relationships. I was\nleaning against a telephone pole at the intersection where we’d agreed to\nmeet after work, thinking to myself.\n“Nah.” I nodded a greeting at Sawatari and asked, “What’d you want to\ntalk about?”\n“Oh, good to meet you. My name’s Miho Sawatari. I’ve seen you at\nwork a lot, but…um, I guess this is the first time I’ve spoken to you, huh? It\nmakes me kind of nervous, somehow.”\nI’m the one who should be nervous, lady! my mind griped to itself. It’s",

They were doing this just to spite me—I was sure of it. Pretty\nsure, anyway.\n“Oh, there’s nothing to be nervous about,” I replied. “Satoru Mikami.\nIt’s good to meet you, Ms. Sawatari…although you’re famous enough\naround the office that you hardly need to even introduce yourself, huh?\nTamura and I went to the same college, and we kinda hit it off during his\ntraining period, so that’s how we know each other.”\n“Famous? Oof! Not famous in a weird way, I hope?”\n“Oh, y’know. I hear stories about you dating Kameyama or messin’\naround with Mr. Kihara in management…”\nSomehow, I decided that picking on her would be a good idea. I just\nmeant it as a passing joke, but it made Sawatari’s face turn a bright shade of\nred, her eyes watering up a bit. It was cute, in a way. People were always\ntelling me to tone that stuff down—that I needed to consider people’s\nfeelings more or, if not that, at least make it funnier—but I couldn’t help\nmyself. So mark that down as another failure. Maybe I really do have a crap\npersonality.\nTamura took that chance to intervene, giving Sawatari a pat on the\nshoulder. Dammit, Tamura! So blessed with the natural charm you need to\nlive a decent life… I wish people like you would just explode!\n“Aw, stop being mean to her,” he admonished with an effortless smile.\n“And don’t worry, Miho, he’s just having a little fun with you.”\nCool, refreshing, and completely guileless—Tamura was impossible to\nhate. He was still just twenty-eight, quite a bit younger than I was, but we\ngot on well nonetheless. I probably owed him at least a few\ncongratulations…\n“Hah, sorry,” I said, figuring there was no reason to let my jealousy\ndevour me. “I can’t help but needle people like that sometimes. But no\npoint standing here on the sidewalk. Wanna get something to eat while we\ntalk?”\n“Aaaahhh!!”\nScreams. Chaos. What is—What’s going on?!\n“Move! I’ll kill you!!”\nI turned around to find a man sprinting toward me, a backpack in one",

And when I shoved my coworker aside on the street, some random\nmaniac stabbed me. Good. I remembered all of that. Which meant I must be\nfine. No need for panic. That wasn’t like me anyway. I was known for\nhaving a cool head. The last time I panicked, it was grade school and all I\ndid was wet my pants, just a little bit.\nI tried looking at my surroundings.

Wait a sec. I needed some time\nto deal with this.\nWhenever I start freaking out, I always find it helpful to sit still and start\ncounting prime numbers until I calm down. Let’s try that. One, two, three—\nWait, one doesn’t count as a prime number, does it?\nUgh… Now wasn’t the time for this. I couldn’t let myself think about\nthis stupid crap. This was bad, wasn’t it? Like, what’s going on, here?! Was\nI…like, past the point of no return, unless I did something?\nPanicking, I checked to see whether I was hurt anywhere. I didn’t seem\nto be.

An anxiety like none I’d ever felt\nbefore began welling up in my mind.\nAm I…in a coma or something?\nI was conscious, certainly, but had I gotten detached from my central\nnervous system, maybe?\nOh, man, anything but that! I mean, think about it. When you throw a\nguy into a dark, enclosed space, it takes practically no time at all for him to\ngo insane. And that was exactly where I was—and I couldn’t even die in\npeace any longer, it looked like. If insanity was all that waited for me here,\nthat was enough to take the wind out of anybody’s sails.\nJust then, I felt something brush against my body. Hmm? What’s that? I\nfocused all of my senses on this unknown sensation. It felt like grass against\nwhat might have been the side of my stomach. Concentrating on the\nsensations, I slowly began sussing out what was around me. I could feel the\npointy edges of some nearby leaves prick against my body.\nIt made me a little happy, really. I was in total darkness a moment ago,\nbut now I had my sense of touch back, at least. It made me so overjoyed\nthat I made a beeline for the grass, and—\nCreep.\nI could feel my body sliding flat against the ground. I… I moved?!\nThis, at least, was clear evidence that I was not on any kind of hospital\nbed. The feeling beneath my stomach (?) took the form of hard, jagged\nrock. Hmm. It still didn’t make much sense to me, but I appeared to be\noutdoors.\nSo I headed toward the grass, keeping my senses keen against what I\ntouched, although I still wasn’t quite clear on where my head was. There\nwas nothing to smell; I wasn’t sure whether I had that sense or not.\nReally, I had no idea what I was shaped like. I felt…flowing.

You have no intention to take\naction?”\n“Yes, sir,” Fuze replied with a voice devoid of emotion, silently asking\nthe baron what he was so perturbed about. “I do not feel any action is\nnecessary.”\nThe baron, not a great fan of this response, chose to keep those feelings\nhidden. “Rather a strange thing to say, is it not? Not necessary? The\ndisappearance of Veldora the Storm Dragon may portend further monster\nactivity in the space of days, even hours! And you are taking no measure at\nall against it?”\n“It would strike me as rather strange to do so, sir, for taking such\nmeasures is the job of the state. I am responsible for the Free Guild, not for\nproviding volunteer work when bidden.”\nThis was the truth, as far as Fuze was concerned. The Free Guild was an\nindependent, nongovernmental agency. Its members were afforded no\nspecial guarantees of security or comfort—unlike the assorted workers and\ncraftsmen on the government ledger—but the basic rights that all citizens\nwere entitled to. Their only official debt to the kingdom came in the form of\ntaxes.\nThat was the system in Blumund, as it was in nearly all the nations that\nsurrounded it. To put it another way, the Free Guild was a group that\noperated outside the framework of any nation—and one far more unified\nthan a single government as well. It was a fact that some of their operations\noccurred without the knowledge or consent of these nations, whether the\nguild intended it to be seen that way or not.\n“Is it not the responsibility of the state,” the guild master meekly\ncontinued, “to protect the assets of its people? In the same way, it is the\nguild’s responsibility to protect the lives of its members. We both have a lot\non our plates, I suppose.”",

The baron knew his position was being probed.\n“Enough pretense, Guild Master! How many mercenaries can you\nprovide us? How many adventurers with combat experience? What is the\nsize of the defense force you can provide in service? I need numbers!”\nThe guild master gave a roll of his eyes and sighed. “I do hope we are on\nthe same page when I say this, sir, but I will remind you, we are not an\narmy of volunteers. If we are talking about a mobilization based on the\nterms of our agreement, I can provide you the equivalent of one-tenth of our\nmembers. If you wish access to anything beyond that, well, that would all\ndepend on our compensation.”\nThe population of Blumund was almost exactly one million. The\nmembership log of the local Free Guild totaled around seven thousand,\nfamily members not included. Thus, if the kingdom decided to invoke its\nagreement with the guild and muster 10 percent of its members—seven\nhundred in all—these fighters would officially join the command of the\nnational army.\nSuch an order, of course, would apply only to guild members who\nbelonged to Blumund and no other nation. All Free Guild members fell\nunder the same banner, but their home nations were also clearly stated in\nthe logs for this reason. What’s more, while a nation had the right to define\nits own mobilization period under this agreement, it was also obliged to\ngive the guild a one-fifth discount on taxes collected during the entire\nperiod. This allowed governments to rapidly summon a powerful force, and\nthe guild to make sure its men would not be obligated to the state for too\nmuch of their time. For a group like the guild, which was required to pay\nsalaries to all deployed members in advance, it was the obvious approach to\ntake.\nBesides, even if a government asked for every man the local Free Guild\nhad, there would be no way to handle them. After all, only about half of any\nguild’s membership had any fighting skill.\nThe Blumund nobles were fully aware of this. Normally, they wouldn’t\nhave their top minister attempt to bully the guild master into better terms…",

Are you trying to wring the truth out of me,\nFuze?”\nFuze’s eyebrows raised a little at the mention of his name. Veryard\nrarely, if ever, called him by it. He turned his eyes toward the baron for the\nfirst time.\n“The area near Veldora’s prison was meant to be absolutely\nimpenetrable,” he said. “Now that route may potentially be open to direct\nnavigation—and that means we must consider the possibility of the Eastern\nEmpire taking action.”\n“Ah, certainly so!” the baron replied. “Whether they were letting\nVeldora be or were simply afraid of the seal being broken, we have been\ndetecting sudden new movements in the Empire after a long period of\nsilence. Do you understand what that means? If they can navigate that\nforest, this kingdom will be swallowed up instantly. And we can forget\nabout the Western Holy Church providing us any meaningful support! The\ncountries around the Forest of Jura have no meaningful alliance with each\nother. We will all become Empire vassals in the blink of an eye!”\n“No support from the Church…? I fear not, no. They never were terribly\ninterested in wars between mere mortals in the first place. Annihilating the\nmonsters is what their doctrine calls for.”\n“Quite so. If we could have them deploy even one of their paladins, the\nEmpire wouldn’t be so quick to move… Not needing to prepare for monster\nattacks would buy us some time, at least.”\n“I doubt anything could stir the Church to action,” Fuze said. “The\ndestruction of a nation or two does nothing to affect their own finances.\nThey cannot help everyone, nor even their own flock.” He took a moment\nto gauge the baron’s face. Veryard looked exhausted, as if he had aged\nrapidly in just the past few days. It was understandable.\nThe two of them were childhood friends. And even though Veryard was\nmerely a baron, if the public knew of Fuze’s close contact with a member of\nthe nobility, it would create assorted difficulties for the both of them. They\nboth had to pretend to use each other for their own personal gain, which\nwas why they usually portrayed their relationship as surly and resentful.\nIt would take more than the power of a small kingdom to overcome this\nthorny obstacle they now faced.

There was no guarantee the Empire would act against them. If it\nwas going to, it would undoubtedly be with a large force. It was never a\nnation to waste its time with small skirmishes. No, it would casually send\nover a force of a million or so and trample over every nation in the area, one\nby one. Assembling such an army would take time, at least three years or\nso.

There was a gigantic, ominous-looking serpent\nin front of me, a jet-black one with thorned scales, tough skin, and an\nappearance that made the snakes of Earth look positively cuddly. This\ncreature in my path made me feel like a deer—or a slime—in the\nheadlights.\nMy mind went blank. Maybe I’d be okay if it didn’t notice me? Slowly, I\ntried to slide myself back. No luck.

The area was\nhome to several goblin villages, including this one, and even the small\nclashes so far had resulted in a large number of goblin deaths—including\nsome named goblins.\nOne of these named creatures was the sort-of guardian of this village,\nand with his death, the value of keeping this village intact had declined\ndramatically.\nThe other goblin communities had largely abandoned this land. Their\nreasoning was that they could coerce the newcomers to attack this village,\nbuying them time to come up with countermeasures of their own. The\nvillage elder and the leader of the expedition who greeted me had tried to\nreason with them but were coldly brushed away. The frustration was clear\nin their voices as the two of them explained.\n“I see,” I replied. “So how many of you live in this village?

What kind of impossible game is this? I turned my eyes toward the\nvillage elder. He didn’t seem to be joking; his eyes were as sincere and\ndedicated as a goblin’s could get.\n“So these goblin fighters took them on in such small numbers, even\nthough they knew they couldn’t win?”\n“…No. This information I told you… Those fighters risked their lives to\nobtain it.”\nOh. Might’ve been a rude question, there.\nUpon further questioning, the named goblin they’d lost turned out to be\nboth the elder’s son and the older brother of the scouting party. I spent a\nmoment weighing the options, the elder falling silent as he awaited my\ndecision. It might have been my imagination, but I could have sworn there\nwere tears in his eyes… I was probably just imagining it, though. Tears\ndon’t go too well with monsters.\nBetter pump up the swagger, I figured. That’s how a feared monster\nshould rightly act!\n“Let’s get something straight, elder. If I help this village, what do I get in\nreturn? Do you even have anything to give?”\nNot that I minded helping them out on a whim. But it took ten goblins to\nmaybe beat one big dog or whatever, and they’d be facing a pack of a\nhundred. It wouldn’t be simple. I think a little black-snake action could take\ncare of them…but I can’t just snap up this job without thinking a bit.\n“We shall give you our allegiance! Please, grant us your guardianship. If\nyou do, I promise we will swear our loyalty to you!”\nHonestly, as gifts go, that’s not much. But after experiencing ninety days\nof silent solitude, even talking to goblins was kind of fun.

It was something he had\nlearned through hard-fought experience, amid the many skirmishes he had\nwitnessed against the Empire over several decades.

I’ll think about it\ntomorrow, once everyone wakes up.\nFor the time being, I ordered the goblins to camp out next to the fire,\ntold the dogs to go on standby around the village, and called it a night.\nMorning came.\nI had spent the previous night thinking, mostly. The conclusion I came\nup with: Let the goblins take care of the direwolves! Perfect!\nWe had a total of seventy-two goblins left in fighting shape. No\ncasualties from yesterday. At most, a few scratches. Meanwhile, we had\neighty-one surviving direwolves parked outside the town fence—some\nwounded, but none so badly that a little recovery potion didn’t prop them\nright back up. They could’ve recovered themselves, I reckoned, with their\nintrinsic healing skills.\nThe morning began with me lining up the goblins who were awake. The\nchildren and elderly watched from the side.

I didn’t get much of one. They were waiting\nfor me to continue, I guessed, not making a single sound as they stared at\nme.

Hang on, do any of these guys have names at\nall? How are they supposed to call for each other and stuff? What a pain in\nthe ass.\n“Elder,” I said as I watched the pairing process unfold to my side, “it’s\ntoo inconvenient for me to refer to you and your people. I’d like to give\nnames to you all. Would that be all right?”\nEveryone must have heard me somehow. Right at the word names, every\nsingle one of them was locked on to me—even the nonfighting goblins,\nclearly thrown by this turn of events.\n“Are…are you sure…?” the elder timidly asked.\nWhat’s the big deal, huh?\n“Y-yeah, um… If it’s not a problem, I’d like to give out some names?”\nIt was as if I’d simultaneously blown the minds of every goblin on the\npremises.

I’ll be\nhappy to take yours once your body is firmly buried in the ground!”\nNothing the man blurted out did anything to change Leon’s facial\nexpression. “Hmph,” the knight in black calmly said to him, “I see leaving\nme, at least, to guard you was a wise choice. It looks like one of the rank\nand filers sniffed this place out.”\n“Bah,” the demon replied just as the knight was about to unsheathe his\nsword. “Another would-be meddler from the gallery. Very well.” He looked\nat me. “It is time, Ifrit.”\nWhat did he mean? I was confused.\n“Hmm? What is it, Ifrit?” he asked, an inscrutable look on his face.

Burning, stop, stop it—”\nWhatever König was attempting to shout, he never quite managed to\npiece together a full sentence. My flames consumed him.\nMy heart filled with fear. I knew that right here, by my own hand, I had\nkilled a magic-born person. Yet I could feel my whole body lightening with\na sense of strangely deep satisfaction. It was hard to explain—as if I had\njust completed something I was meant to do. It felt as though my mind\nbelonged to someone else. The terror was unbearable.\nBut… In another moment, it all fixed itself. Ifrit’s consciousness filled\nmy soul anew, bottling up my anxieties and my fear.\nIt did, in the end, keep me from going mad inside. It helped shelter me\nfrom the guilt I should have felt at killing. Not that I was incapable of that\nemotion—Ifrit just exercised his complete control over me to ensure I never\nfelt it. To ensure that I, his host, never lost my mind and died on him.\nSo began my strange symbiotic relationship with Ifrit, something I\nneither wanted nor hoped for. The same thing happened again, numerous\ntimes—and again, I killed the intruders for Leon, never feeling a thing.\nI had no regrets. I was young; I still didn’t know right from wrong, and I\nleft everything to Ifrit. I simply acted, unfeelingly, dragged along by the\ncreature’s will to dispatch those in his way.\nOne day, the demon lord spoke to me. “Heh-heh. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

That was what drove me to\nimprove.\nOne day, I befriended a young girl named Pirino, a gentle, quiet girl just\na tad older than I was.

She was the\nfirst friend I ever had in my life.\n“What did you name it?” I asked her.\nPirino gave me another look. “Name it? Monsters don’t have names.\nThey can communicate with each other through their minds.”\n“But I’d feel bad if this guy didn’t have a name, though. Hey, is it okay\nif I come up with one?”\n“Really? But they said we aren’t allowed to name monsters…”\n“Please? Come on, just once?”\nI didn’t quite understand what Pirino meant. No matter what it took, I\nbelieved the wind fox deserved a name. After a few more moments, she\ngrudgingly nodded at me—and in another moment, we were both having\nfun coming up with names.\nUltimately, we settled on “Pizu,” a mixture of Pirino and Shizu. It\nseemed to symbolize our newfound friendship, in a way. I was happy with\nit.\n“Fweee!!”\nIt would always cry with glee like that whenever Pirino or I used its\nname.

We’d just figure out what to do once we\nshowed up.\nFor a goblin on foot, it would apparently take around two months to walk to\nthe Dwarven Kingdom. We would be largely following the Great Ameld\nRiver, which flowed through the forest, up to its source in a mountain range\nthat held the settlement we sought.\nThese were the Canaat Mountains, which neatly separated the Empire to\nthe east and the small litter of nations here and there around the Forest of\nJura. There were, by and large, three trade routes that ran between the two\npockets of civilization. One put you right through the forest; another was a\nmore treacherous route through the mountains; the third was by sea. The\nJura route would normally be the shortest and safest, but for some reason, it\nwas only rarely taken advantage of—most travelers challenged the\nmountains instead, what with the travel costs and potential sea-monster\ninterference a ship route presented.\nIn addition to these three routes, there were a handful of other ways to\nreach the Dwarven Kingdom, but they all charged tolls. This was\nmandatory, supposedly to keep people from transporting dangerous goods\nalong the paths. It was a decent enough option for small bands, but the\nlarger caravans avoided them for the costs and time involved. They were\nsafe, no doubt, and we’d have to consider one of them later, depending on\nhow our finances held out.\nWe had no business with the Empire, so there was no point traveling east\nto leave the woods. It was straight north to the Canaats. We wouldn’t have\nto go up to any peaks, at least—the kingdom was situated at the base of the\nmountains, in the upper reaches of the Great Ameld. A beautiful hub of\ncivilization, by the sound of it, built into a gigantic natural cavern.\nThat was the Dwarven Kingdom.\nSo we followed the plan, tracing the Great Ameld River’s route\nnorthward.

Today it was firmly closed, but at the\nbottom of the great doors were two small entryways meant for regular\ntraffic. The right-hand one had nobody in front of it—probably meant for\nthe nobility or any other lofty figures who showed up. The door we were\nwaiting for was on the left, and while some people bore passes that allowed\nthem free entry, others had to undergo luggage checks in a separate\nchamber. All of this, of course, was guarded by a security detail whose\nequipment certainly reminded you that this was the Armed Nation. They\nweren’t clowning around.\nOnce you were through security, you were pretty free to do what you\nwanted around the city, it seemed…but man, what a line. We were bound to\nspend more time waiting than traveling at this rate.\n“Guess we’re really here, huh?” a nearby traveler ventured as I scanned\nthe line of people down the corridor. “That’s a fancy gate.”\n“Look at the armor on that soldier!” his companion exclaimed. “We\nprobably couldn’t afford gear like that after ten years on my salary.”\n“Yeah, I’ll bet! Even the Eastern Empire tries to keep things peaceful\nwith these guys—in public, at least. With that kind of equipment, I see\nwhy.”\n“You said it. They sure ain’t gonna give you a second chance if you try\nanything. The blowback would be one hell of a headache for any nation that\ntried it!”\nMaybe the dwarves of this world weren’t the kind, gentle, almost\nlovable beings I was picturing. They could be a lot more violent than that,\nfor all I knew. Still, as a free city and a hub of trade across races and\nspecies, it maintained at least a public face of neutrality. The fact that the\nHeroic King never allowed combat inside the city was fairly common\nknowledge among adventurers. I supposed that even in this world, you\ncould afford to be neutral only if you had the muscle to back it up.\nAs I mused over this, I began hearing some more sinister voices.\n“Hey!

People (maybe could have) said I\nhad the patience of a saint back home, but this was starting to irk me.\n“Gobta… You remember the rules I gave you all before?”\n“Y-yes, sir! Absolutely!”\n“Good.

I can\nintroduce you to a talented blacksmith I know!”\n“That would be perfect. Thank you!”\nThings were looking up, finally. We just got priority entry, one—\ninspection, schminspection—and we had some extra money to spend. I\nthought finding a weaponsmith who wouldn’t rip me off at first sight would\nbe a chore, too, but a military referral was about the best I could ask for!\nMaybe I can afford to be a bit optimistic after all!\n“In exchange for that…”\nMmm? A catch? The only “catches” I ever liked were the ones on porn\nsites.\n“If you have any of those recovery potions left, would you be interested\nin letting go of them?”\nAha. They must really be short on them, huh? That soldier mentioned\nthat yesterday. Well, I’ve got a ton I could sell you guys…but I don’t really\nknow the going rate.\nNow what?\n…Ah, why not? I had a manufacturing cost of exactly zero on those\nthings anyway. If he wanted some, he could have some.\n“All right,” I replied. “It’ll depend on how many, though. I need to keep\na few for myself, too.”\n“Any extras you’re willing to part with are fine by me. Even if it’s just\none.”",

The Empire had all the riches it could ever want—what\nmotivation could it possibly have to stage an invasion? That was what he\ndidn’t understand.\nOf course, Kaijin added to himself, I doubt the weaponsmiths of this city\nwould mind a good war to fill their coffers.

A sort\nof savant.\nAny one of them could’ve been talented enough to run a successful\nbusiness by himself—but they all had a critical disadvantage.

He was a\nmerchant dealing in battle gear, and he already had steady connections for\nall his merchandise except the weapons.

It was the last thing he wanted to hear. He rubbed his forehead.\n“Well, at least you’re all fine,” he told them. “Glad you got away before\nyou were hurt at all!”\nAnd he was.

It seemed like a bunch of ridiculous\nravings, but these people weren’t ones to make up stories. They didn’t have\nthe talent for it.\nSo did the whole affair really happen? Perhaps it didn’t matter.

Basically, a number of countries were\nsending out orders for weapons and armor, spooked that a certain “idiot\nnation” might be trying to hatch a war on them all. It connected to why the\nguard was out of medicine yesterday, as well as the lack of raw materials\nplaguing the shops.\n“So,” he continued, tapping at his head, “I managed to pull an all-nighter\nto get an order for two hundred steel spears squared away…but I gotta\ncome up with twenty swords, too, and I ain’t even got one yet.

It sounds plausible to me.\n“What’s the difference between lances and swords?” I asked.\n“I need special ore for the swords,” the old guy spat out. “Magic ore.\nThe spears are just simple steel spikes.”\nWithout the right materials to work with, even a master artisan is merely\na man. It must have been incredibly frustrating. The minister must’ve been\nwaiting for him to show up, hat in hand, begging for mercy.\n“And that’s not the half of it.

Even\nthe base ore could rival gold in value, for a simple reason: It was both rare\nand useful for a variety of applications.\nIt all came down to the magicules that seemed to form nearly everything\nin this world—something that Earth seemed to do just fine without but that\nplayed a huge role over here.\nOn rare occasions, when a monster was defeated, it would drop an entire\nchunk of magicules, referred to as “magic stone.” This was a sort of\nportable energy source, and it served as the fuel for something called “spirit\nengineering,” an invention exclusive to this world. Magic stones came in\nlevels of purity, and the purer ones were used as cores inside assorted\nproducts. Even ornaments could harness this energy for special effects. The\nresulting clothing and accessories could boost the wearer’s abilities, grant\nthem additional effects, and do any number of other things.\nNow, the main difference between plain old ore and magical ore was\nthat the latter could be obtained only in areas where higher-level monsters\nlurked. It required the combination of regular ore, a large concentration of\nmagicules, and eons of time for the ore to absorb the magic and make the\ntransformation—a sort of geological mutation.\nOf course, any place with a lot of magic also tended to have a lot of\nmonsters. Not the run-of-the-mill kind adventurers could kill for pocket\nchange—you wouldn’t find any magic ore around them. You’d have to\ntravel to places with at least B-ranked monsters in them.\nAs a tangent, Kaijin finally gave me a full description of how the\nranking system worked for monsters.\n“Ohhh!” I said. “So I’d be, like, a B or so, maybe?”\n“““……”””\nI imagined everyone was thinking the same thing. Except for Gobta,\nwho was a little slow. Let’s leave him alone for now.\nRegardless, the point was that magic ore didn’t just pop up out of\nnowhere. What’s more, the magisteel extracted from it took up 3, maybe 5\npercent of its total mass. Even a fist-sized chunk of that steel was worth at\nleast twenty times its weight in gold.\nIt also appeared that prices, in general, averaged out to near the same as\nthey did in my old world. Gold was used as currency because it was worth a\nlot, just like back home. As a result, all the countries had adopted gold as a\ncurrency standard.",

No way they\ncould’ve known, but…what if they had? Or was that just my paranoid,\nlower-middle-class upbringing coming out?\nNow, on to the real issue.\nMagisteel was rare, certainly, but that wasn’t what made it so valuable.\nThat lay in how readily adaptable it was to serving as a conduit for magical\nforce.\nOne could control magicules through the power of imagination, to some\nextent. My Magic Sense skill worked that way, but even Control Water\nworked by manipulating the ambient magic around me. Most monster skills\nharnessed it one way or another as well. I didn’t know that much about\nmagic spells, really, but I figured they worked on the same premise.\nSo what happened if a weapon was made of material infused with vast\namounts of magic? Amazingly, it became a weapon that could mature!\nHow classic! Aw, man, now I want one! I almost said so out loud before\nstopping myself just in time. I mean, think about it—a sword that gradually\nmolded itself to your ideal shape based on what you wanted from it.\nDepending on your own magical force, you might even be able to transform\nit midbattle!

But what if—although\nthis would take a lot of skill and money—you made a blade of pure\nmagisteel and inserted a magic stone into it? Could you make, like, flame\nswords and blizzard swords and stuff?\nMy creative juices started flowing. My heart sang, demanding Kaijin\nmake one right this minute. But I would have to be patient. The next magic\nstone I get my hand on, though… For sure.\nAfter that quick lesson, Kaijin buckled down and went to work. I\nwatched him as his would-be young apprentice.

And here I was worried whether a fist-sized lump would\nbe enough for even one. Turned out Kaijin couldn’t even guess how much\nit’d cost to use 100 percent magisteel on everything. I suppose not. No\nwonder nobody’s come up with a flame sword or a blizzard sword or even a\nthunder sword. It’d cost too much. Makes sense.\nInstead, magisteel formed only the core of the weapon, and the rest of\nthe blade was crafted from regular steel instead. That core was all it needed\nfor its magic to work its way into the steel, eventually merging itself with\nthe whole sword. That, he said, was why a weapon grew stronger as it was\nused over time. The blade would never rust or lose its shape—it could just\nuse ambient magicules to regenerate itself.\nOddly enough, though, even these magic swords had their life spans. If\nthey were bent too far or otherwise warped beyond recognition, the magic\nwould leak out, leading to rapid weathering.\nKaijin showed me his freshly forged sword as he spoke. It was all so\ninteresting to me. I took the weapon in hand as I marveled over it—all right,\nnot in hand, but close enough. It was simple in make, straight as an arrow.\nNo bells or whistles. It wasn’t meant strictly for slicing like a katana, but\nthe blade seemed suited to slashing.\nBut this was just a base. Over time, I supposed, the sword would adapt\nitself to whatever its user wanted from it. No wonder the forger kept things\nsimple.\nOkay.\nSo Kaijin and his team had crafted this lovely sword for me, as\npromised. Now it was my turn.\n“Right!” I said. “Time for me to pull a little secret work for you.

Kaijin had given him an invite, but he’d refused…only to come\nto the nightclub anyway thanks to his brother’s boorishness. Simply running\nwould have been an easy enough plan for us, but chances were it’d be\ndoomed from the start.\n“Hmph!

Was there some reason for it?”\nKaijin’s expression immediately soured. With a sigh, he began to\nexplain. It turned out he used to be a captain in the palace’s royal knight\ncorps—a leader of one of the seven armies making up the whole system.\nThree corps were devoted to behind-the-scenes work like engineering,\nsupply, and emergency aid. Three more—heavy strikers, magic strikers, and\nmagic support—played more of a starring role. The last one, and the most\nimportant, was the king’s personal guard. Kaijin had been head of the\nengineering corps, and Vester had been his second-in-command.\n“He was the son of a marquis,” the dwarf moaned. “A noble title he\nbought with money. I think he must’ve been jealous of a commoner like me\ntaking the head role. It was complicated, you know? It must’ve been\nhumiliating to him, taking orders from someone below him. And I’ll admit\nthat I didn’t care much about what other people thought about me. I was too\nbusy trying to stay on the king’s good side. That’s when it happened.”\nThe “magic-armor affair.”\nAt the time, the engineering corps was seen as the lowest of the army’s\nseven departments—barely producing any new technology for itself. Vester\nbelieved a kingdom rich in technology should have an appropriately famous\ncorps of engineers, while Kaijin was more of a status-quo man when it\ncame to research and development. Despite how intense their arguments\ngot, they never managed to reach an agreement during their countless\ngarrison meetings.\nAlong the way, the corps launched a so-called magic-armor soldier\nproject with a team of elf engineers. Vester was hell-bent on making this\nproject a success and boosting the corps’s position in the military pecking\norder. Kaijin warned him that he was proceeding too quickly with it, but\neven then, Vester had little time for the advice of a common-born man.\nIn the end, thanks to Vester’s arbitrary whims, an experiment went awry\nand led to a spirit-magic core running out of control—a very public failure\nand a bad setback for the project at an early stage.",

As head of the engineering corps,\nKaijin wound up taking the heat for it, resigning from his position in the\narmy. Not only did Vester make Kaijin the scapegoat; he even convinced his\nfriends among the higher-ranked leaders to give false testimony against\nhim. That, according to Kaijin at least, was the truth.\nOnce he finished, Kaijin let out a tired sigh.\nI could understand his perspective. There must’ve been a lot of\nresentment built up over the years from that.\nStill…man, Vester’s just a total storybook villain, isn’t he? They don’t\ncome easier to spot than that. As far as the minister was concerned, Kaijin\ncould make a comeback in the military and threaten his position at any\ntime. That kind of thing.\nDidn’t he deserve the death penalty, really? Maybe not, but…\n“So,” Kaijin concluded, “maybe he’ll settle down a bit if I leave the\ncountry for a while.”\nHe sounded a bit forlorn about it, but at least he had backup. The three\nbrothers with us were just as aware of the truth, and there was no love lost\nfor Vester among them, either. Hell, even I hated him now.\nStill, Kaijin did sock a noble, so I kind of wondered whether they were\njust gonna release us and wave good-bye.\n“I wouldn’t worry about it,” Kaijin reassured me. “I’m out of the army\nnow, but I did make it up to the corps leader. As far as my social position\ngoes, I’m just below baron. If it were strictly commoner versus nobleman in\nthe courts, well, hanging might’ve entered the picture.”\nHe accentuated that morbid fact with a hearty laugh.\nMeanwhile, I just sat there.

It also made\nthings like strategy meetings easier for us. It remained effective across a\nrange of half a mile or so, which was more than enough for my purposes.\nOn the second day, the dwarves seemed largely capable of remaining on\ntheir rides without passing out.

It meant that\nnations could expand only into the range their armies could physically\ndefend—small pockets of civilization in an otherwise wild land.\nThere would be times when towns fell under attack from powerful\nmonsters. Three-headed snakes, winged lions, and such. Whenever these\nso-called calamities appeared near a settlement, they would cause as much\nconsternation as a full-scale war.\nOf course, one might expect governments to cooperate and create\nsupport systems that extended beyond national borders. And such\nagreements did exist, but such support always came after things were stable.\nIn the meantime, it was seen as a country’s own responsibility to defeat the\nmonster in question.\nThis was why those with full rights as city-dwellers were granted special\ntreatment, while the others had to make do with life in neighborhoods built\nin the hazardous areas around the walls. Such people eventually acclimated\nto a life of being pillaged and exploited. The stronger among them saw an\nadventurer’s career as a way to protect themselves.\nThe wealth gap quickly grew between rich and poor. It was a dog-eat-",

Goblin cuisine used to be\nall about spit-roasting—but now they’d added simmering to the mix!\nThis was a truly remarkable development.

I was glad they’d kept their home base safe, at least.\nThe resident hobgoblins spotted our returning party quickly, greeting us\nwith cheers and applause. I had rudely forgotten to bring souvenirs, but\ngiven the monster pelts and such I spotted drying here and there—proceeds\nfrom their hunting, no doubt—I was sure the dwarves would have everyone\nkitted up and clothed before long. I’d like the goblins to make that stuff\nthemselves later, but let’s take it one step at a time.\nI tried looking around for Rigurd so I could introduce the dwarves to\nhim. I didn’t need to. He ran right up to me.

I guess I’ll find out, I thought as I\nbounced in.\nOnce I passed under the flap, I stopped. Inside were a bunch of goblins\n—the regular kind. Several of them were well dressed, each one\naccompanied by a handful of servants. Some elders and their guards,\nmaybe? Nobody was armed. Not that I minded that.\nBefore I could ask what was up, the goblins prostrated themselves on the\nfloor.\n“““It is an honor to meet you, O great master!””” they all shouted in\nunison. “““Please, listen to our most earnest of hopes!”””\nGreat master?

It\ncame as a surprise, but—hell—it beat hemming and hawing over every life\ndecision I made. Kept it simple.\nBy the way, if these were just the envoys, how many goblins were we\ntalking overall? I sighed. I might have a hell of a lot of names to think up\nsoon.\nThe guards accompanying the goblin elders had gone back to their\nrespective villages to report the news. So what did they have to say?\nTo sum up, their story went a bit like this…\nIt all began with the recent disruptions to the order around the forest.\nThe other villages had de facto abandoned Rigurd’s during the direwolf\nattack in part because they simply had no combat resources left to assign to\nthe place.\nAll the intelligent races in this forest—the orcs, the lizardmen, and the\nogres, too—were starting to step up and stake their claims on this wood.\nThere had been smaller arguments along those lines before, but there was\nalso a sort of silent agreement that nobody would let it get to armed\nconflict. With the forest’s one and true overseer out of the picture, however,\nthere were more than a few races out there ready to vent some steam.\nMonsters, in general, had a tendency to puff up and engage in regular\ndisplays of power. Now every village in the forest was rapidly preparing\nitself to kick some ass. It was only a matter of time before something got\nthe ball rolling. And goblins, the wimpiest kids on the block, were doomed\nto let most of these other races lay total waste to them.\nThis, naturally, alarmed most of the other goblin elders. The moment\nthey got involved in this cross-forest turf war, it’d be over for them. So they\nheld a conference, talked it over for several days, and were all too\nblockheaded to come up with any decent ideas.\nNot that I would have expected them to…\nNews of the impending direwolf attack came in the midst of this, but\ntheir attention was focused elsewhere.

Some suggested to travel to\nthem immediately and beg for protection. Others found the tale too\nextraordinary to swallow, concerned that it might be a trap and refusing to\nbelieve that the ex-goblins would have no reason to trick them.\nTrap or not, though, there was no guarantee this new race would accept\nthem.

As I walked around, I realized that the most ideal\nlocation was…the area right nearby the cave I’d popped out of. Hmm.\nI decided to ask Rigurd about the state of things over there. “It was\nregarded as a forbidden zone,” he reported. “Unlike the forest, it was a\nveritable den of powerful monsters…”\n“No problem there, then. I mean, I lived there.”\n“Y-you what?!”\n“Like, I guess I was born around there, so…it oughta be fine.”\n“…You constantly impress me, Sir Rimuru. I am astounded.”\nFunny thing for him to say.

I thought it’d be nice if we\ncould set up a pseudo–septic system that could store waste and turn it into\nfertilizer. We’d need something to keep infectious diseases at bay, besides.\nThat was another thing I added to Mildo’s list.\nDo goblins get sick, though? I wondered. The answer was yes—they\nwere susceptible to disease like anyone else. Pretty wimpy monsters, if you\nasked me. Though given the kind of filth they lived in before I showed up,\nno wonder…\nThey lost a lot of people but made up for it with an abundance of babies.\nSimple math.

Mildo, for his part, actually had considerable\nknowledge about waste systems like this. I must not have been the only\notherworlder to talk about this with people.\nThis world, for its part, had something called “spirit engineering,” a\nunique field of study that led to all sorts of weird discoveries. What it didn’t\noffer, however, was a way to make fertilizer out of people’s dumps.

What’s your problem?!”\n“Ahh, you know her. Once she decides on something, there’s no\nchangin’ her mind.”\n“Thank you.”\nThose words of gratitude were all the masked figure said before silently\nfollowing behind them. Thus Kabal and his band found themselves with\nanother companion as they ventured into the forest.\nThe sound of chopping trees and hammering echoed throughout the forest.\nSlowly, the new town and its houses were beginning to take shape. In our\nminds, at least. We were still busy laying out the water and septic system,\nso for now, it was still just a clearing.\nThis system took the direction of its flow from the river we were\nadjacent to. We planned to have a water-processing building eventually,\nalthough it was still under construction. That’d be where the river water was\npurified and distributed to people’s houses.\nOn the septic end of things, we built a large chamber out of wood that\nwe planned to bury in the ground. The wood’s inside surfaces would be\ntreated to improve their resistance to rotting, then reinforced with cement.\nThat was what we were working on now. We’d lucked out and found some\nquicklime-type material off a nearby hill.\nMeanwhile, another building outside of town would be our wasteprocessing facility, where we planned to make the fertilizer we wanted.\nIn addition to this, I was having the crew build a large temporary\nbuilding, a sort of gymnasium they could sleep in during construction.

It was basically\nbuilt in the shape of a cross, with a wide main street, making it easy for\ntownspeople to work as a group if the need arose. We’d have to be careful\nnot to create long lines of identical roads—that’d make it easy to get lost—\nbut it wasn’t too much of a concern.\nThe only real disadvantage to this setup was that it could be easy for\nenemies to move around in case of invasion—but if they actually made it to\nthe center of town, it’d mean a dozen other things would have failed by\nthen.\nNo point dwelling on that scenario. If we got wrecked, we could always\njust rebuild.\nIt was absolutely a good idea to name all the goblins and upgrade them\ninto hobgoblins, though. It did wonders for their intelligence levels, and\nthey were all astonishingly quick studies. Their strength was upgraded, too.\nThe dwarves described regular goblins as straight-on F-ranked monsters,\nwhile hobgobs hovered between C and D for the most part. They felt more\nlike people than they did before, to be sure. Depending on their weapons\nand armor, not to mention their classes and magical arts, there was a lot of\nroom for growth.\nOn that note, I was seeing substantial variation in the hobgobs’ sizes and\nstrengths. The four goblin lords I’d just named, for one, all seemed more\ntalented in life than the rank and file did. Rigurd the Goblin King,\nmeanwhile…\n“Oh, is that where you were, Sir Rimuru? I was searching for you!”\nWho was this guy? He was practically a muscle-bound freak of nature at\nthis point, huge in frame and almost the size of an ogre. “Hell, larger,\neven!” as Kaijin put it. That must’ve been the result of giving him a class in\naddition to a name, I supposed.\nI swear, the biology of these monsters was a total mystery to me.

Some country’s checking out this place? I already knew from the\ndwarves that the Forest of Jura was considered neutral territory, unclaimed\nby any nation. It seemed plausible that this was an expeditionary force,\ntrying to find some new territory to take for its own. This could be trouble,\nbut there was no point fretting over it without hearing them out. I could\nthink about what to do after that.\n“All right. Take me to them!” I said as I hopped on Rigurd’s shoulder.\nRanga being out on patrol made transport around our new town a bit of a\npain. I could walk easily enough, but when I was by myself, my lack of\nheight was an issue. I always resented the feeling of being looked down\nupon whenever I met anyone. Having people kneel to greet me just got in\nthe way of actual work. I had a reputation to uphold, besides, and I didn’t\nwant to be under people all the time. Perhaps I worried about it too much,\nbut I always thought it was better to avoid trouble before it started.\nThat was why I tended to travel around on a lot of shoulders these days.\nSo aboard Rigurd’s shoulders, I made my way to see these adventurers.\nWho are they? I wondered before a conversation entered my (figurative)\nears.\n“Wh-whoa! Hey! I wanted that!”\n“That’s just mean, isn’t it? I raised this meat myself!”\n“Sir, I regret to inform you that I am not giving up this food!”\n“Munch, munch.”\nCertainly seemed like some excitement.",

That was kind of the goblin king, to be sure. “Oh, that’s no\nproblem,” I replied. “In fact, good job noticing. Helping out someone in\nneed is a nice thing, you know?”\nI felt it was appropriate enough to praise him.

If only I had a sense of taste. Argh… Does\nanyone have some spare taste buds…?\nWhoops, got a little distracted there. I turned my focus to the matter at\nhand.\nRigurd walked up to a tall seat on one side and placed me upon it. “My\nguests,” he bellowed as he sat next to me, “I do hope you are comfortable\nhere. Allow me to introduce you to our master, Sir Rimuru!”\nI could hear them swallowing down their food. Then, in unison:\n“““Huh? A slime?!”””\n“Munch, munch.”\nAll of them reacted with shock.\nWell, I’m not sure about the last one, actually. Whatever.\n“It is good to meet you. I am Rimuru, a slime. Not a bad slime, you",

I was a bit concerned about the\nwood and other supplies we had piled up, but there wasn’t much I could do\nfor it now.\nThis giant had a hell of a lot of nerve, though! With that attitude of his, I\nwas sure he saw me as nothing but an annoying little bug in his way. He\nwas dissing me, and that was more than enough to get on my bad side. Ifrit\nwas my enemy, and I decided now was the time for a counterattack. I had\nmy qualms about Shizu, the person Ifrit was probably feeding off of for all\nthis, but if I didn’t strike, this would never end.\nSuppressing Ifrit was priority one; I could check up on Shizu later. For\nall I knew, maybe Shizu wasn’t being controlled at all.\nI shot a Water Blade at Ifrit’s stomach. It evaporated right before\nreaching the flame giant; a spiraling plume of fire cut it off. Hmm. Guess\nthat won’t work. But I didn’t have time to ponder it, because the\nsalamanders had just reacted to my attack.\n“Icicle Lance!!”\nElen’s ice magic stabbed its way through one of them. As I took a peek\nat her, she was already fleeing back into her corner of the Magic Barrier.\nIt was a clever attempt. It looked as if the barrier was holding up well\nenough without much concentration on the caster’s part. But it’d take more\nthan an Icicle Lance to shoot down those salamanders.\nOne of them lunged straight toward the adventuring trio.\n“You all right?!”\n“I can do this!” Elen said. “Risking our lives is nothing new to us!”\n“Oh, come on,” Kabal groaned, “I thought I was the leader! Well, so be\nit. I’ll take one of ’em down!”\n“Yeah?” Gido retorted. “I ain’t heard of a bandit fightin’ an elemental\nspirit before. Guess we’re all in this together, huh?”\nIt was hard to tell whether they really counted on each other or not.\nIf Kabal was that eager to “take one down,” I might as well let him. If he\ndied, though, that was gonna weigh on me.\n“All right,” I said. “You take him. But don’t push it! If you get hurt, use\nthese.”",

Even one\nwould be a tough opponent for them. Hope they hang on okay.\nThe other two salamanders, meanwhile, had started making their way\ntoward me. Ifrit himself was calmly advancing, too.\nNow what?\nJust as the thought occurred to me, Ranga finally arrived. I’d expected to\nhave him keep watch over the adventurers, but no longer. He’d be serving\nas my mount instead.\n“You called for me, my master!”\nI hopped right on his back. At least I had some speed now. The\nsalamanders were pretty quick up there, but not as quick as Ranga.\n“I want you to focus on dodging them,” I ordered. “You don’t need to\nattack at all. I’ll take care of that!”\n“Understood!”\nWe had almost a wordless connection with each other. Ranga instantly\nunderstood what I wanted to do.

If I’d still been a human, they probably would’ve\nturned me into a black divot on the ground.\nI’d better take care of those two guys first before tackling Ifrit. So I tried\nout some Water Blades. Unlike the fire giant, the salamanders couldn’t cut\noff the attack before it hit home. I managed to slice off a limb…but,\nridiculously enough, the guy grew it right back again. It must’ve been made\nof fire like everything else. Just cutting it off wouldn’t accomplish much.\nThe black snake probably exuded more raw strength than these guys, but\nthe salamanders’ special powers would make them a tad trickier to defeat.\n“…My master, physical attacks will not work against spiritual foes.\nStriking their elemental weakness or using magic will,” Ranga explained.\nOh.

His\ndomain occupied the lands just beyond the forest. I should have chosen that\nmoment to take my leave of their party. But…I don’t know. I suppose I just\nwanted to see, along with these adventurers, what kind of home these\nmonsters had made for themselves.\nIt was a strange place indeed, this town our rescuers lived in. It was no\ndank lair or stinking, filthy den. A “town” was the only way to describe it.\nThe shock I felt was beyond comprehension. This wasn’t some rude\nshelter, some glorified hole in a mountain. It was a proper town, one they\nhad built for themselves from scratch.\nIt was under construction, I should probably add. It had been surveyed\nand laid out, and building materials had been placed in each section, ready\nto be converted into houses. There were no buildings yet; the monsters were\nstill living out of neat rows of tents. But they had even started their work by\nfocusing on the underground infrastructure. I had never heard of anything\nlike it on this planet.\nIt was a bizarre settlement.\nBut it was bursting with energy. The residents, despite being monsters,\ntruly seemed to enjoy working on it. Most of them were hobgoblins, but\nthey seemed to share their lands with the black direwolves. A tad different\nfrom the ones I was familiar with, and I didn’t think it was my imagination.\nThe leader of the hobgoblins spoke very fluently to me. I imagine he\nwas the most intelligent among them. He even prepared food for us.\nRemarkably, though, he turned out not to be the leader at all. Instead, he\nwas joined by a slime—one who lay back in his lofty throne, acting as if he\nwere king of the world. It might be odd to say a slime could “lie back” on\nanything, perhaps, but that really was the sense he exuded.\nThis slime was the strangest thing of all—for he, in fact, was the leader\nof all these monsters.\nIt was hilarious.\nI couldn’t help but do a spit take as he spoke. “I’m not a bad slime” was\nhow he chose to describe himself!

But—\nI kinda didn’t want to admit it, but I actually was familiar with this form\nafter all. It was from a long time ago, maybe thirty years or so.\nThis was how the world looked to me back when I was still bumbling\naround in elementary school.\nHang on a sec. I was too excited to notice at first, but there was one key\ndifference.\nIt wasn’t there.\nMy should-have-been newly born manhood, that is, which I was\nexpecting to see down below. It wasn’t there!

I don’t even want to imagine what that’d look\nlike without hair. Nope. That’s a dangerous line of thought.\nReally, though, I thought I’d keep a cooler head than this.

That all came down to this human form’s abilities.\nSomething I hadn’t considered with this replica of mine before actually\nconjuring it was that my enhanced thought processes allowed me a\ncomplete, real-time link with my copy. It and I were both “me” in a way—\nthere were no appreciable differences between us. If anything, Ifrit’s\nReplication skills couldn’t hold a candle to mine—his copies were clearly\nimitations, but mine wasn’t at all.\nAll right. Almost not at all. One big difference was my copy’s capacity\nfor magicules—it held only whatever I cast upon it when creating it,\nalthough I was free to “install” more inside if I wanted to. I had a fair\namount of magic to work with, so depending on the application, I could\nprobably do a lot with it.

Any foe who ran into this skill would think I was cheating.\nThe third and final “oh, crap” reason: the way it seemed so breezily\nnatural to me, taking this form. That was something I noticed when I\nrealized no dark mist had surrounded my body.\nTake my black wolf form, for instance.\nI definitely used the mist to create that form, although it made for\nweaker results compared to my slime self.\nIt was hard to notice thanks to the limited movement available to a form\nwithout limbs, but a slime’s cells were powerful things—each one could\nserve as a muscle cell or a brain cell or a nerve cell.

That, I\nfigured, was what made the replication “inferior,” if anything, to the real\nthing.\nAs for this mist-free human transformation?\nYou guessed it—it had the exact same reaction speed as my regular\nslime form. No wonder it felt so natural. Having limbs also improved my\nmobility immensely. Even in child form, it was so much easier to get\naround than as a slime, although it tired me out more quickly.\nThe biggest thing, though, was that the lack of black-mist usage meant\nturning human cost me zero magic.

He could only imagine it, since he hadn’t been captured\nyet, but none of his friends had ever come back alive from such an\nencounter, so all Gobta could do was imagine the terrifying results.\nHe could’ve just kept his hands off the fields and gardens, of course. But\nGobta and the other goblins didn’t quite grasp the concept of agriculture.\nAll they saw was an open field with lots of fruits and vegetables growing in\nit. It was human territory, and they knew from experience that getting found\nwould lead to a chase, but nothing could overcome their hunger.\nSo Gobta escaped down a narrow trail beaten into the earth by the local\ncreatures, chewing the sweet flesh of a melon the whole way. The trail was\nbarely visible at all, the sort of thing only a small goblin could successfully\nnavigate. There would be no entry for the larger humans, who could only\nstop at a distance and lob insults at him instead.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief at his good thinking. Finding an escape",

Indeed, these are too large for us to handle, either.”\nEavesdropping as he passed by, Gobta figured they were trying to sell\nsome magical something-or-others to the kobolds. Human equipment,\nbarring shortswords and daggers, was too large for goblins.\nArmor, too, was out of the question. Clothing made out of things like\nhard leather could be taken apart and used in piecemeal fashion, but\nmetallic pieces were too much to work with. None of the goblins had that\nkind of knowledge.\nMagic items were a big unknown. Even touching them, they feared,\nwould break them and make them worthless. If not even the kobolds wanted\nthem, it was a classic case of pearls before swine.\n“How about this, then?” one kobold suggested to the goblins as they\nscratched their heads. “If you are willing to travel to the Dwarven\nKingdom, they should be able to take these items from you. They would be\nwilling to accept it as payment for dwarven hardware and the like, and they\nwill gladly deliver your purchases to you as well.

Something told him this favor wouldn’t be\nmuch to his liking.\n“Look at this knife,” the elder continued. “Don’t you think it’s a\nwonderful piece? If you do this favor for us, I’ll be happy to give it to you!”\nThe gleam of the blade was more than enough to grab Gobta’s attention.\n“Say what you will, sir! I’ll handle whatever you need!” he blurted,\nimmediately forgetting his earlier sense of foreboding. But perhaps that was\nunavoidable. The silvery gleam on this knife was the product of the magic\nimbued inside. It immediately robbed Gobta of the ability to engage in\ncritical thought. His mouth had moved before his brain did.\nAh!\nBut it was already too late.\n“You will, then? You will travel to the Dwarven Kingdom for us?”\n“Huh? Me?!”\n“May we count on you for this?”\nNow the elders surrounded Gobta, identical smiles on their faces. The\nsight of their stern eyes above their upturned lips forced Gobta to nod\nmeekly in response.\nIt was said that the average goblin’s life span was no more than a fifth of\na human’s. Their lineage could be traced back to the ancient fairy-affiliated\nraces, allegedly, but given their current degenerate monster selves, it was a\ntenuous link at best. Even the longest-lived were lucky to see their twentieth\nbirthday, and most racked up only a decade or so before shuffling off. The\nage of three, when goblins were ready for reproductive activity, was seen as\nthe start of their adulthood, with full maturity at age five.\nThey were not very strong creatures, and as a result, their species made\nup the difference through explosive numbers of offspring. Relatively few\nsurvived to adulthood, however, making the cruelty of nature all the more\nobvious. Only about half of all goblin children reached full maturity, and of\nthose, less than half ever saw that fifth birthday.\nIt was simply the lot they were given, and considering these short lives,\ngoblins did not have the habit of acquiring language skills. They could\nspeak words, yes, but this was done strictly to communicate their intentions",

The roundtrip would take several months—a hefty part of a goblin’s life span—and he\nwould have to risk everything he held dear. Yet nobody in the goblin village\nconsidered it to be a terribly important mission. To the elders and other\nmature adults, they were simply taking a rough-sounding assignment and\ngiving it to a child with nothing better to do.

He was a goblin child, still not fully grown, and\nthey were strapping a load the size of a mountain on his back and sending\nhim off on some grand quest.

Gobta started to think. Then he had\nan idea.\nWhy don’t I put all this junk in a box and pull it behind me?\nThis, unfortunately, didn’t work. The box refused to move. Gobta\nscratched his head some more. Then he remembered the really big box he\nsaw once, near a human settlement, with a horse pulling it around.\nOh yeah, that one had some round things on it, didn’t it…?\nWhat he was remembering was a cart, and the “round things” were\nwheels, although he didn’t have the words for them in his vocabulary.

He took a straight\nclub, then used his shiny new magical knife to whittle it down to size. Then\nhe put a couple of holes in the box with his belongings and ran the stick\nthrough the both of them. He jammed the twin shields onto both ends of this\nmakeshift axle and bound them in place with some handy vines he’d found.\nA couple extra pieces of wood for handles, and voilà—an instant pullwagon.\nWith a few rags piled on top to keep things from falling off—and a few\nmore from the village to keep warm in the evenings—he was set.

There was still some\nwater left, but not much, probably.\nThe wagon, meanwhile, kept getting stuck on tree roots and such,\nsapping Gobta’s strength.

The particular type\nof mushroom he chose was dangerously poisonous, but only if heat was\napplied to it—grilling, boiling, whatever. The juices of its meat would then\ntransform into a lethal compound, something Gobta had no idea about as he\ninadvertently chose the safest way to enjoy it.\nHaving a full stomach did wonders for Gobta’s spirits. He filled his\nleather skin from a pool of water inside a cavity in the tree, then decided to\ntake a rest, not too interested in traveling any farther that day.\nHis wagon was set to break apart at any moment, but luckily there were\nsome useful vines nearby he used to lash it back together, as well as some\nhandy sap from the tree to fill in the assorted holes and crevices that had\nappeared. The bark from the tree did wonders to patch up the largest breaks\nin the box, too.\nWith that vital work complete, Gobta slept the rest of the night, relieving\nhis fatigue. He woke up the next morning, surprisingly chipper considering\nhow yesterday had gone, and began foraging, picking up some ediblelooking nuts and wild strawberries—and spotting some more of the\nmushrooms from the previous day.\n“I’ve never seen such a dangerous-looking mushroom!” he exclaimed to\nhimself. “Not even I could eat something like that.” So he left them behind,\npicking a duller-looking mushroom to take along in his pocket. Given all\nthe brightly colored, poisonous-looking mushrooms in the area, he figured\n(in his hazy memory) that this must’ve been the one he’d eaten.\nMan, was I lucky to find this winner among all the poison ones!\nSo he foraged around a little more before deciding to set off. It was still\nbefore morning, and he didn’t have the foresight to stockpile food a little\nmore before departing—so instead he slowed down, searching for more\nedibles along the way.\nA month after he departed his home village, Gobta finally arrived at the\nlarge river he was told to look out for.

He was\nfamiliar with creeks and the like, and he loved playing in them, but this was\na whole other level of grandness. He had seen nothing like it before. The\nsight was unimaginable, and it was little wonder that it amazed him.\n“Hyaaahhhh! This is so great!!” he shouted. The sight of the flowing\nwater never got old to him. He sat there the entire day, just watching it go\nby, until night fell.\nThe next morning, fully satisfied at the view he had taken in, Gobta set\noff early. Only when he was about to start walking did he notice an\nimportant issue.\n“Huh? They said to follow my left hand once I reached the river,” he\nwhispered, not expecting an answer. “But if I turn around, it’s going in the\nopposite direction…?”\nHe was right. He knew he had put a mark on his left hand so he’d\nremember which one it was when it came time to tackle that important\nissue. The only problem: It turned out his left hand would point in different\ndirections whenever he moved. Follow his left hand where? That was the\nhard part.\nIn the end, he decided to pick up a tree branch he found at the side of the\nriver, let it fall to the ground, and travel the way it pointed. The fact that it\nwound up facing the correct way was another testament to Gobta’s\nastounding luck. He followed the branch’s lead, not doubting it for a\nmoment, and the trip went problem-free from there.\nJust when the journey was starting to bore him a little with its simplicity,\nGobta saw some shallows in the river up ahead. It was a watering hole for\nthe forest animals nearby, although none of them seemed to be fighting each\nother. They were avoiding confrontation at this spot—a sort of instinctual,\nunwritten law of nature, perhaps. Carnivore and herbivore were here\ntogether, one of the few places in the wild world where you’d ever see it.\nThat rule, however, was reserved for the animal kingdom. Humans and\nmonsters didn’t adhere to it. Neither did Gobta.

There were even smaller birds and\nhares and such, drinking on the far edges to avoid the others.\nHis eyes swam as he took in all the options. Then he found a wild hare\n—a slower-looking one, fat and juicy to his eyes. The perfect size for\nsomeone like Gobta. Anything larger would’ve been too dangerous.\nApproaching his target, Gobta stopped after a short distance and\ncarefully observed his surroundings.\nAll right. So far, so good.\nHe grinned to himself, slowly closing in as he gathered a few stones\nfrom the ground. In a moment, he was within what he felt was comfortable\nthrowing range. His stealth skills, honed by a long career of raiding\nvegetable gardens, paid off for him.\n“Yah!”\nBrimming with confidence, Gobta launched a stone at the hare. His\nunerring aim gave him a clean hit, and the animal fell into the watering\nhole. The others around it immediately darted off. Gobta didn’t care. He\nwas already salivating by the time he picked up the body.\nThen, a problem occurred.\n“Grooooooooar!!”\nWith a mighty wail, a magical beast appeared from between the trees. It\nwas standing majestically atop a small cliff, and slowly its eyes turned\ntoward Gobta.\nThis was a blade tiger, the so-called king of this dense forest. It enjoyed\na rank of B, pretty well ensuring that an F-ranked goblin stood no chance.\nThis beast was here for the animals around the watering hole, just like\nGobta was—but thanks to Gobta taking action first, all the animals had\nscattered, leaving the blade tiger with nothing. Nothing, that is, except\nGobta himself. And his catch, of course, but that wouldn’t be nearly enough\nto sate this monster.\n“Gehh! Are you after me?!”\nThe blade tiger leaped from its perch, unfazed by the height of the cliff,\nand landed in front of Gobta without a sound.

His left hand still had a stone in it, but\nagainst a blade tiger, that wouldn’t accomplish much.\nMaybe that would work…\nHe suddenly recalled the knife given to him before his departure. Maybe\nit could wound the creature? And maybe, if he was lucky, that’d buy him\nenough time to escape. Once he made that conclusion, there was no time to\nwaste. There was nothing else at his disposal, so he decided to believe in his\nchances and keep resisting until the end.\nFirst, Gobta lobbed the stone. The knife was his real ticket out of here,\nbut if the tiger dodged it, he was dead. So he used the stone first to distract\nthe beast. The blade tiger easily leaped out of its way, and Gobta,\nanticipating where his adversary would land, removed the knife from his\npocket and prepared to hurl it toward—\nUm, this is a mushroom…?\nIt took a few moments for him to realize that it was no knife he was\nabout to throw at the blade tiger.

It turned\nout that this mushroom was a rare poisonous type, one containing spores\nthat were loaded with lethal venom. Gobta had been walking around with\nthat in his pocket the whole time, and then he’d thrown it at a magical beast.\nThe blade tiger glanced at the mushroom hurtling toward its face, then\nopened its mouth. It used its Voice Cannon skill in an attempt to vaporize it\n—which proved to be a mistake. The pulverized mushroom immediately\nreleased all its spores, which floated on the breeze and landed all over the\ntiger’s body.

Quickly, he planned his escape, making sure to pick up his hare\nbefore he left.\nReaching his battered old wagon, he tossed the bunny corpse on top of\nthe load and ran away at full speed. He kept going as long as his breath\nwould let him, until he finally made it to what seemed to be a safe place.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief, having escaped what had been the greatest\ndanger ever to occur in his life.\nBeing freed from certain death immediately reminded Gobta that he was\nhungry. He recalled the hare in his possession, but not even he was simple\nenough to let his guard down here. He decided to move over to the riverbed,\nwhich would give him a good view of his entire surroundings, and used\nsome stones and dead sticks to fashion a serviceable outdoor stove.\nThe danger of the past few moments was now firmly behind him as\nGobta’s thoughts turned to his appetite.

Everything was a new sight to\nGobta, and everything grabbed his interest.\nBut he didn’t have the time to leisurely take in the sights. He was almost\nout of food again. He was already in lands more or less under the protection\nof the dwarven king, mostly grasslands outside the Forest of Jura. He tried\nto collect as much as he could before he took up the mountain road, but not\nonly would there be no replenishing his stockpiles—those stockpiles were\nstarting to look pretty meager.\nThe breathtaking views around him helped Gobta forget about his\nhunger, but it was now time to face reality.

What a kind dwarf that was!\nPutting on the coat, then the backpack over that, Gobta left the shop. His",

Thanks to some clever engineering that\nallowed natural sunlight to enter the city’s living spaces, however, it was\nmore than bright enough to see by. At night, the fluorescent moss that\ncovered the cave’s walls provided about as much light as a full moon.\nOne issue was how people handled fire. The kingdom wasn’t an\nenclosed space, but the cave made it easy for clouds of thick smoke to form,\nmaking ventilation a priority. As a result, whether indoors or “outdoors,”\nthe use of fire was restricted, with firemen required to be on hand at all\ntimes near workshops, kitchens, and any other workplace that handled\nflame.\nWhich meant that cooking food was allowed only in certain places,\nalways indoors.\nUsually, if he was uncomfortable, he could just douse himself in some\nwater. But Gobta had just wrapped up a long journey. To be blunt, he was\nrank. It was to be expected, given goblins’ lack of regular bathing habits.\nHe didn’t stand out too much in the shops near the entrance, which were\npacked with freshly arrived adventurers just as smelly as he was, but things\nwere different in the lodging quarters. There was ventilation, yes, but\nGobta’s natural smell was more than enough to alarm the people around\nhim.\nIn the merchant areas, passersby and visiting merchants visibly crinkled\ntheir noses. It was enough to make even Gobta feel socially awkward.\nI don’t really like it here… Maybe I should leave sooner rather than\nlater.\nFeeling ashamed, Gobta decided to head home.\nThat was the right decision to make. For one thing, he had no money\nand no way of eating while he toured the city. He didn’t even understand\nthe concept of money, for that matter, which was why he had just wrapped\nup a huge bartering session with that dwarf. There was no way around it.\nSo Gobta decided to wrap up his little tourist jaunt and get back on the\nroad—and then he saw it. A store festooned with beautiful, eye-catching\ndecor, filled with goddess-like women chatting with each other. The goblina\nbodyguard from the caravan had seemed divine to him before, but these",

They were elves, particularly fairylike members of\nthe sprite races.\nConcepts like beauty and ugliness would normally be dependent on the\nrace or species one belonged to. There were no absolutes. However, when it\ncame to goblins, their likes and dislikes were closer to people’s than not. It\nwas a relic from their fairy heritage, and while their looks had retrogressed\nmore than a little over the years, they were still magical in nature. It was to\nthe point that some particularly senseless goblins would even attack people\nwith procreation purposes in mind.\nSo lovely! I wish I could make friends with a pretty elf girl sometime,\ntoo!\nGobta wanted it to happen. And he knew that getting stronger was the\nonly way to do it. Just as that caravan guard had said, if he was stronger,\nbeautiful women would like him—that was how his thought process\nworked.\nIt was with that new goal in life that Gobta spent his single night in the\nDwarven Kingdom. It seemed foolish to depart for the wilds at night, so he\ncamped out in the park near the main gate instead. The cave at least\nprevented him from getting rained on, and the coat that nice dwarf had\nmade for him kept the cold at bay. It was a more comfortable night than\nhe’d expected, and Gobta awoke bursting with energy.\nThe fountain in the park apparently used spring water as its source,\nallowing passersby to drink from it. Gobta took his skin out from the\nbackpack, filled it up, and set off, leaving the Dwarven Kingdom behind\nhim.\nSomeone spoke to him right after he passed through the gate.\n“Oh, is that you, kid? Is your work done here?”\nGobta looked up to find a kobold merchant. Two hobgoblin fighters\nwere behind him, along with the goblina with the muddy red hair.\n“Oh, it’s you!” Gobta exclaimed.\nThe caravan was also just about on its way. Richer merchants would\nspend several nights in the city, enjoying the assorted entertainment options",

Get in, do\nyour business, get home, and relax with your own kind—that was how they\nnormally worked.\nThe kobolds invited Gobta onto their caravan after greeting him.\n“We’re taking the same route, aren’t we? We have room, so why not join\nus? Just provide us some protection if any bandits or magic beasts show\nup,” their leader said with a grin. He was expecting nothing from Gobta, of\ncourse—this was just a polite excuse to get him on the wagon. Gobta,\ncompletely insensitive to sarcasm, laughed with him, a little proud to be\noffered such a role.\nThe group proceeded along the river path, blessed with an uneventful\njourney as they pressed through the grasslands and plunged into the Forest\nof Jura. Gobta had ample wild birds to hunt wherever they rested, a decent\nsupply of nuts and fruit to gather—and he did his part, pooling his resources\nwith the caravan’s.\n“You’ve got a real talent for this, don’t you?” the leader said, a tad\nastonished. “Look at all the food you’ve tracked down for us…”\n“Indeed,” another kobold interjected, “you must know the Forest of Jura\nlike the back of your hand. In the woods, you’re a lot more help than I’d\never expect.”\n“Quite true. I had no idea you had this kind of talent!”\nGobta, his latest catch in one hand and a spare stone in the other,\ncouldn’t hide his joy at this. Nobody ever praised him this much in the\nvillage. He enjoyed it.\nOne day, they came across those poisonous-looking, brightly colored\nmushrooms again—just like the one Gobta had inadvertently eaten to quell\nhis hunger.\nYou can’t eat these… But hang on. Huh? Those normal-looking\nmushrooms over there look kind of dangerous, too. Was that really the one I\nate?\nThere was a spark of self-doubt in his mind—but those mushrooms were\ntoo colorful, and too bloodred and foreboding as well, to be considered\nedible at all. Even Gobta, who was rapidly letting all the praise get to his\nhead, was a little iffy about trying it.\n“Um, those plain ones? You can’t eat those,” the goblina told him.\n“Those are known as firespores, and they’re deadly. The stronger ones even\nexplode if you expose them to fire, spreading poison all over the area. I",

No way would he ever\neat anything so dangerous.\nIgnoring the firespores, Gobta and his friends focused on gathering nuts\nand fruits instead. In addition to the group he was in, there were others by\nthe river, replenishing their water supply, as well as cooking the food they’d\nfound.\nJust as they all had finished their jobs and were about ready to prepare\ndinner—\n“Groooooar!!”\n—they heard a terrifying, earth-shattering roar. A magical beast\nappeared, exuding rage as it eyed the caravan. It was that blade tiger again,\nthe B-ranked beast that Gobta had inadvertently defeated a few months\nback. The poison spores had damaged it, but it had been lucky enough to be\nnear a lake that must have helped it recover. It was still as angry as ever,\nthough, more than angry enough to convince the low-ranked goblin that had\nonce escaped it that all was lost now.\nThe beast, proud by nature, had sworn it would avenge the slight upon\nits reputation. With another roar, it used Voice Cannon to cleanly blow one\nof the guards away. The single blast made it all too clear how powerful the\nblade tiger was—even the stoutest of hobgoblins would face grave injuries\nafter taking the brunt of it. If it weren’t for the full-plate armor protecting\nhim, he would have died instantly.\n“My brother!”\nAnother hobgoblin let out a yelp of surprise, but he was too petrified to\nmove. All he could do was hold an unsteady ax in his hands and keep a\nwatchful eye on the blade tiger. No one could blame him. Hobgoblins were\nranked C or so. They weren’t made to take on a tiger like this.\n“Don’t prod him,” the female guard quietly warned. “This guy’s\ndangerous. It’d take ten of us to have at least a chance of taking on a blade\ntiger. Merchants! We need to give up our goods and slowly step away from\nthe area.”\nShe knew that angering a blade tiger would do nothing but make the\nsituation even more treacherous. She at least wanted her clients to survive\nthe encounter. While the tiger was feasting on their horses, they could at\nleast attempt an escape—if they were lucky, they might even make it.",

Then it snarled at the kobolds slowly edging away from\ntheir encampment. The merchants fell to the ground, understanding they’d\nbe allowed no mercy.\n“Well, this is it,” one of the guards muttered. “It’s not gonna let us go.”\n“What should we do, miss? We can’t win this?”\n“Guess we gotta charge it. Merchants! Once we’re on our way, I want all\nof you to run like hell! And don’t bunch up, either, unless you want to die.”\nThe guards were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their\nclients, using themselves as bait to let them survive. Despair filled the air\naround them, but one among them failed to read the mood. That was Gobta,\nof course, who took the blade tiger’s roar as nothing less than his big\nchance.\nIt’s that tiger, isn’t it?! The guy I chased off with that mushroom? Even I\ncould beat him!\nIt would have been a fatal mistake for anyone else, but Gobta was the\nonly one in the camp not completely stricken by terror. He leaped forward\nas the blade tiger let out another sinister snarl.\n“You fool!” the female bodyguard shouted. “What could you ever do?!”\n“You can leave this to me!” Gobta shouted back with a smile. Then he\ndashed into the forest. The blade tiger immediately gave chase, ignoring\neverybody else.\nThe rest of the group were left dumbfounded, if only for a moment.\n“That idiot… How could he be so reckless…?”\nThe seemingly selfless move shook the guards to the core, but they\nknew they couldn’t let this chance go unheeded.\n“Everyone! Get out of here now! We’ll hold that thing off here!”\n“But…”\n“Don’t worry. This is our job. If we can get away from that monster,\nwe’ll send a flare up to signal you.”\n“He’s right. We’re not intending to die here, either. I’d kinda like to see\nyou guys again, all right?”\nWith that, the guards piled the merchants into the wagon.

It deserved every bit of its B rank when it came to speed, and\nsoon it was right on Gobta’s heels.\nMaybe I shouldn’t have tried to act all cool back there—\nThere was no point regretting it now. Gobta was too busy trying to\nwiden the gap to care. But even as his chances of being cornered grew by\nthe second, another brilliant idea entered his mind.\nMaybe if I use this—\nGobta stopped, standing his ground, and took something out from his\npocket. With a defiant grin, he threw it straight at the blade tiger. The\ncreature stopped, more surprised at the sudden end to this chase than at the\nobject hurtling toward its head. This would normally be when the blade\ntiger used Voice Cannon, its mightiest weapon, to pulverize whatever was\nin front of it. But the memory of its past errors made the tiger hesitate.\nIt was intelligent enough not to repeat the same mistake twice—but what\nwould normally be an advantageous trait spelled doom for it. Instead of\nVoice Cannon, the blade tiger figured it would bite down on the incoming\nobject to stop it. With its reflexes, it would be an easy thing to do.\nBut the moment the object was between its teeth, Gobta shouted:\n“Unseal!!”\nBefore the blade tiger could understand it, the incantation took effect.\nJust as Gobta had hoped, the magical tube provided to him by the transfer\noffice did exactly what it was made to do—unfurling all the pots, pans,\nweapons, and even his wagon inside the tiger’s mouth.\nThis had exactly the effect Gobta had been hoping for—it ripped the\nblade tiger’s jaw off its head.\n“All right!” Gobta shouted in joy. But that wasn’t the end of his plan. He\nstill had one final weapon on hand—his Flame Knife. Considering a blade\ntiger’s performance in battle, merely losing its lower jaw wouldn’t be\nenough to send it down for the count. That was why Gobta figured his pride\nand joy—his one magic weapon—would be what it took.\nThen Gobta noticed the (slightly bloodied) items strewn on the forest\nfloor.\nBut if I burn this here, I’m going to burn my stuff, too, aren’t I?

Instead, it followed instinct and gave chase again.\nThe pain was intense, but it was the humiliating loss of Voice Cannon\nthat made it especially furious. All that filled its mind was a consuming\ndesire to kill Gobta for good.\nAfter creating a measure of distance between him and the tiger, the small\ngoblin dove into a dense thicket. This reduced the blade tiger’s advantage\nand further widened the gap between Gobta and his pursuer.\nTurning around, Gobta focused on the blade tiger. Just as he’d thought,\nit was making a beeline for him.\nOkay! I can’t miss from here!\nCaught up in the dense underbrush, the tiger found itself robbed of its\nmobility. A straight throw, Gobta figured, was all he needed to hit home—\nand he had magic to trigger, too. Not even a magical beast would crawl\nhome from that in good shape.\nWith Voice Cannon gone, the blade tiger had nothing to block with.\nGobta knew it.

A\nmagic weapon like this would normally be nothing to a B-ranked magical\nbeast, but the tiger was on its guard. Fatally so, as it came to be.\nUsing one of the bladelike fangs on its upper jaw, the blade tiger\ndeflected the flame-infused knife. Gobta gasped in despair…but that was\nexactly what he needed. The Flame Knife bounced off the tooth, hurtled\ndownward, and thrust itself into the ground. There, as it happened, grew a\nmushroom with certain special qualities. A kind that spat out lethal poison\nwhen exposed to heat. One that was fully mature, ripe, and packed with\nspores.\nThe firespore exploded in all directions around it, triggering cascading\nexplosions across the area. The blade tiger was right in the thick of it, with\nno escape, its body exposed to every one of the searing spores.

Gobta was victorious.\nIt was now time for them to take their own paths—Gobta deeper into the\nwood, the caravan back along the river to the demon lord’s lands.\n“I broke my treasure in the battle,” Gobta whined, “and I’ll have to pull\nthat wagon all the way back home, too…” The smile on his face, however,\nindicated he wasn’t especially torn up over it.\n“Well, thanks to that, you saved us all,” the head merchant said. “We\nreally need to thank you again.”\nGobta grinned sheepishly at them.\n“You know,” the goblina guard stammered, “I—I think I could—”\n“I’m gonna get stronger, miss!

It likely gave Gobta all the encouragement he\nneeded to keep striving for loftier heights, besides.\nThus the two of them parted ways.

As a result, I\nsuppose I should write a word or two of thanks to the original forces that\nbrought this book to life.\nFirst, thanks go out as always to the people that read and supported this\nstory on the web.

I graduated from college, landed a job\nat a sort-of-big general contractor outfit, and with my older brother taking\ncare of our parents for me, I was currently enjoying all the myriad benefits\nof the bachelor-pad life. Age thirty-seven. No significant other. I wasn’t exactly short or frumpy or hideous or anything. But when it\ncame to the opposite sex, apparently I had nothing to offer. I’d made efforts\nalong those lines, with varying degrees of dedication, but by the third\nrejection, something fizzled out within me. Besides—really, at this age, I\nwas kinda past the point where a girlfriend needed to be my main focus. Work kept me busy enough. Plus, it wasn’t like I was gonna die without\none. …I’m not making excuses, all right?\n\nIt’s just that I started thinking…\n“Oh, hello, sir! Sorry we’re late!”\nThere he was, walking toward me, bursting with all that youthful energy\nof his. He and the beautiful woman next to him. His name was Tamura, one\nof the guys who worked under me, and she was Sawatari, the front-desk\nlady and pretty much the “it” girl around the office. These bums asked to see me because they were getting married and\nwanted my advice.\n\nIn other words, this meeting was the whole reason I was\nbrooding over why I was such a failure at personal relationships. I was\nleaning against a telephone pole at the intersection where we’d agreed to\nmeet after work, thinking to myself. “Nah.” I nodded a greeting at Sawatari and asked, “What’d you want to\ntalk about?”\n“Oh, good to meet you. My name’s Miho Sawatari. I’ve seen you at\nwork a lot, but…um, I guess this is the first time I’ve spoken to you, huh? It\nmakes me kind of nervous, somehow.”\nI’m the one who should be nervous, lady! my mind griped to itself. It’s\n\nnot like I’m any good at speaking to women. How about a little sympathy\nhere? Any way you looked at it, I was the wrong person to ask. I knew nothing\nabout love. They were doing this just to spite me—I was sure of it. Pretty\nsure, anyway. “Oh, there’s nothing to be nervous about,” I replied. “Satoru Mikami. It’s good to meet you, Ms. Sawatari…although you’re famous enough\naround the office that you hardly need to even introduce yourself, huh? Tamura and I went to the same college, and we kinda hit it off during his\ntraining period, so that’s how we know each other.”\n“Famous? Oof!", "token_len": 684, "meta": {"block_types": "semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

I hear stories about you dating Kameyama or messin’\naround with Mr. Kihara in management…”\nSomehow, I decided that picking on her would be a good idea. I just\nmeant it as a passing joke, but it made Sawatari’s face turn a bright shade of\nred, her eyes watering up a bit. It was cute, in a way. People were always\ntelling me to tone that stuff down—that I needed to consider people’s\nfeelings more or, if not that, at least make it funnier—but I couldn’t help\nmyself. So mark that down as another failure. Maybe I really do have a crap\npersonality. Tamura took that chance to intervene, giving Sawatari a pat on the\nshoulder. Dammit, Tamura! So blessed with the natural charm you need to\nlive a decent life… I wish people like you would just explode! “Aw, stop being mean to her,” he admonished with an effortless smile. “And don’t worry, Miho, he’s just having a little fun with you.”\nCool, refreshing, and completely guileless—Tamura was impossible to\nhate. He was still just twenty-eight, quite a bit younger than I was, but we\ngot on well nonetheless. I probably owed him at least a few\ncongratulations…\n“Hah, sorry,” I said, figuring there was no reason to let my jealousy\ndevour me. “I can’t help but needle people like that sometimes. But no\npoint standing here on the sidewalk. Wanna get something to eat while we\ntalk?”\n“Aaaahhh!!”\nScreams. Chaos. What is—What’s going on?!\n\n“Move! I’ll kill you!!”\nI turned around to find a man sprinting toward me, a backpack in one\n\nhand and a kitchen knife in the other. I could hear shrieking. He was\ncoming my way. With a knife.\n\nA knife? And at the other end of it…\n“Tamuraaaa!”\nThe moment I shoved Tamura aside, I felt a burning pain run across my\nback. My body balled up as it collapsed to the ground, trying to withstand\nthe shock.

All this pain and panic was starting to screw around\nwith my consciousness. “T-Tamura… Shut up. It… It’s nothing big, all right?

Too dark to see anything.\n\nWhere was I? What even happened,\nfor that matter? Someone was picking on me for being a celibate sage or\nsomething, and then…\nThat was enough to jump-start my mind again. My name was Satoru Mikami. Just another thirty-seven-year-old in a\nsuit. And when I shoved my coworker aside on the street, some random\nmaniac stabbed me. Good. I remembered all of that. Which meant I must be\nfine. No need for panic. That wasn’t like me anyway. I was known for\nhaving a cool head. The last time I panicked, it was grade school and all I\ndid was wet my pants, just a little bit. I tried looking at my surroundings. Then I noticed—I couldn’t open my\neyes. Odd, I thought as I tried to rub them and my arms didn’t respond. And\nmore to the point, Where’s my head, anyway? This was getting confusing. Like, whoa. Wait a sec.\n\nI needed some time\nto deal with this. Whenever I start freaking out, I always find it helpful to sit still and start\ncounting prime numbers until I calm down. Let’s try that. One, two, three—\nWait, one doesn’t count as a prime number, does it? Ugh… Now wasn’t the time for this. I couldn’t let myself think about\nthis stupid crap. This was bad, wasn’t it? Like, what’s going on, here?! Was\nI…like, past the point of no return, unless I did something? Panicking, I checked to see whether I was hurt anywhere. I didn’t seem\nto be. Physically, I felt terrific. No cold, no heat—perfectly comfortable. That, at least, came as a relief. Now for my hands and legs… Oop. Not so\n\nhot there. No response from any of my limbs. What’s up with that? Getting\nstabbed in the back wouldn’t force the doctors to amputate all my\nextremities, would it? I’d kind of like those back. Then there was the whole “can’t open my eyes” thing. I was in a world\nof darkness, where I couldn’t see a thing. An anxiety like none I’d ever felt\nbefore began welling up in my mind.

When you throw a\nguy into a dark, enclosed space, it takes practically no time at all for him to\ngo insane. And that was exactly where I was—and I couldn’t even die in\npeace any longer, it looked like. If insanity was all that waited for me here,\nthat was enough to take the wind out of anybody’s sails. Just then, I felt something brush against my body. Hmm? What’s that? I\nfocused all of my senses on this unknown sensation. It felt like grass against\nwhat might have been the side of my stomach. Concentrating on the\nsensations, I slowly began sussing out what was around me. I could feel the\npointy edges of some nearby leaves prick against my body. It made me a little happy, really. I was in total darkness a moment ago,\nbut now I had my sense of touch back, at least. It made me so overjoyed\nthat I made a beeline for the grass, and—\nCreep. I could feel my body sliding flat against the ground. I… I moved?! This, at least, was clear evidence that I was not on any kind of hospital\nbed. The feeling beneath my stomach (?) took the form of hard, jagged\nrock. Hmm. It still didn’t make much sense to me, but I appeared to be\noutdoors. So I headed toward the grass, keeping my senses keen against what I\ntouched, although I still wasn’t quite clear on where my head was. There\nwas nothing to smell; I wasn’t sure whether I had that sense or not. Really, I had no idea what I was shaped like. I felt…flowing. Jellylike. Kind of like a certain fantasy monster I was well familiar with. In fact, the\nidea had been running through my head for a while now. …No.\n\nCome on. That’s just silly.\n\nAnything but that.

So…now what?\n\nSuddenly, a voice ran across my mind. Use unique skill “Predator”? Yes\nNo\nHuh? Wh-what? Unique skill “Predator”? And what was up with that voice? I thought I heard something weird\nwhen I was talking with Tamura earlier. That wasn’t just me imagining\nthings? Was someone there? Something didn’t seem quite right with it. It\nwasn’t that I thought I had a visitor, so much as…well, as I just had words\nfloating into my mind. Cold, unfeeling words, like a computer-generated\nvoice. Let’s go with no for now. No response. I waited a while for one, but no further voices came. It\nappeared there wouldn’t be a second question. Did I make the wrong\nchoice? Was this the kind of game where you got stuck if you didn’t start\ngiving “yes” answers? I was assuming the question would just repeat\nforever until I said yes, like any normal RPG. Guess not. Kind of rude of that voice, though. Showing up, asking a simple\nquestion, then disappearing forever. It was nice hearing someone for a\nchange, but…the hell, man? Oh well.\n\nLet’s go on with what I was trying before. My sense of taste. I moved toward the grass I felt earlier. As it brushed up against me, I\nleaned forward, feeling the whole of my weight settle over the field. It was\ndefinitely grass of some sort. Once I was sure of that, I suddenly realized that the area where the\nplants met my body was starting to melt. I thought it was myself melting at\nfirst, but apparently it was only the grass. And with that, I could now tell\nthat the components of the plant life beneath me were being taken into my\nbody. So that was how it worked? Instead of having a mouth to eat with, I just\ningested plant matter with my whole body? It sure didn’t taste like\nanything.\n\nFrom this, there were a few conclusions I could sensibly make. First, I was no longer human. That was a given by now. So did I really\nget stabbed to death? It didn’t seem like much of an open question at this\npoint. It’d also explain why I was resting on a rocky patch of grass instead\nof in a hospital room. What happened to Tamura? To Sawatari? Did he scramble my hard drive\nfor me, like he promised? I was full of questions—but also a suspicion that,\nby this point, none of them really mattered anymore.

So aerodynamic! …Yeah, right! You think I’d accept this just like that?! As far as I could feel, there was no longer any doubting it. I could\npicture it in my mind. I mean…what else could it be?

It was just me, the grass, and\nme eating it for lack of much else to do. It was simply a way to kill time. And by this point, I could sense the entire process—my body absorbing the\nblades, dismantling them internally, sorting through all the components, and\nstoring them away.

The unique skill “Predator” chiefly comprises the following\nfive effects:\nPredation:Takes the target into your body. Lesser chance of success if\nthe target has its own consciousness. Can be targeted on\norganic and inorganic objects, as well as skills and magic. Analysis:Analyzes and researches targets taken into your body. Lets\nyou create craftable items. If the required materials are\npresent, allows you to make a copy of the item. Successful\nAnalysis of the casting method allows you to learn the\ntarget’s skills and magic.

Only\n\navailable once the target has been Analyzed. Isolate: Stores harmful effects incapable of being analyzed,\nneutralizing them and breaking them down into magical\nforce. Um… What? For the first time in a while, I was thrown. That sounded like kind of an\nincredible ability. Not exactly the kind of thing slimes were known for. At\nleast not the ones I knew.\n\nAnd…hang on.

Turned out that was one of\nthe many side effects of evoking that “Great Sage” skill. Holy cats, was that thing helpful. Talk about your best friend in a pinch.

Normally, it would be unable to provide responses in\nthe form of conversation, but in order to answer my questions, it apparently\n\nrevamped itself, diverting part of its “World Language” powers to assist me. That’s how it was explained to me, at least. This useful ability—relaying words into my mind—isn’t normally\npossible. As it explained to me, this “World Language” was heard only\nwhen there were great changes to the world or when you either earned or\nupgraded a skill—something that normally didn’t happen all that often. These skills were obtained only rarely, when the world recognized that you\nhad grown in one way or another. Evolution, meanwhile, was something most people never got to\nexperience in their lives.\n\nIt was all Greek to me, but if that was how it was,\nI was willing to accept it.

Although, back in my home world, having a conversation with my own\nskill might have been considered strange…\nSo there I was, still locked in darkness, asking a barrage of questions. One thing the replies confirmed was that yes, I was a slime now. I also\nfound out why I never got hungry or sleepy. The slimes in this world, it\nturned out, never had to eat if they could keep absorbing the magic\nparticles, or “magicules,” in the air. In less magically abundant regions, I\nwould be obliged to fill up by absorbing monsters or small creatures. Most slimes shied away from areas with low magic presences, but the\nones that didn’t were apparently both quite strong and madly vicious. Usually it was the other way around, where a wealth of local magic meant\nespecially strong monsters.

Since the operational cells used for thought are rotated in and\n\nout at regular intervals, there is no need for you to sleep. This raised the question of where my memories were being held,\nexactly. Maybe it was kind of like a RAID setup on a computer? That would be close enough, came the response. Considering its lack of\npersonality, the Sage certainly came up with some snappy replies. Speaking of which, the “Great Sage” skill consisted of five effects:\nHasten\nThought:\nBoosts perception speed by a thousand times. Analyze and\nAssess:\nAnalyzes and assesses the target. Parallel\nOperation:\nOperates on any matter you wish to analyze, separating it\nfrom the regular thought process. Cast Cancel:Annuls the casting period required when using magic, et\ncetera. All of\nCreation:\nProvides full coverage of all unsuppressed matter and\nphenomena in this world. “All of Creation”? So I know about everything, everywhere, with no\neffort on my part? Score! Or so I thought. It turned out that I could only be told information related to things I’d\nalready heard about—in other words, I needed to recognize and understand\na concept before I could grab a full Analysis of it. And the spell thing—did that mean I could instantly use any magic once\nI learned it? And, like, there was magic in this world and stuff?! The Great Sage replied with a big Yes. Well, once I knew that, I just had to try to learn a few spells myself. I checked with the Sage to see if it could help me cast magic, but that\nwas a no-go.\n\nEh, it was worth a shot. Still, I had another great idea: Could I link the “Predator” Analysis skill\n\nwith “Great Sage” Parallel Operation? Received. It is possible to link “Predator” Analysis with “Great Sage”\nParallel Operation. Do you wish to link them? Yes\nNo\nUh, yeah? Not that I had anything to analyze yet… Wait. Or did I?

Five minutes, and I could’ve had a hundred. And while I didn’t have anything else to compare it to, using my Great Sage\nskills to assess them resulted in a “high quality” rating. So there you go. I was happy enough with it, at least. It all went so fast,\ntoo. I asked the Sage about it, and it said the process usually took more time\nthan that.

Some of your garden-variety weeds were also sprouting here and there,\nbut most of the local grasses were hipokute. How ’bout that? So I decided,\nas a little insurance, to Predate all the herbs I could in the area and turn my\nstomach into a little recovery-potion factory. I didn’t have much else to\noccupy my time. It was still pitch black in here. There was no doubt about it. I had put my guard down. I had a partner\nwho granted me skills and the ability to engage in (kind of passive)\nconversation, and I let it get to my head. I suppose that had a lot to do with how for ninety days in a row, I never\nran into any other creatures. No danger to my life whatsoever. But either\nway, I had let my guard down. For an instant, I was like, “Huh?”\nI felt a sudden sensation that I had grown lighter or heavier or, like…\nunstable. Did I…fall in some water? In the past ninety days, I hadn’t felt so much as a drop of water hit my\nbody. I’d assumed I was in a rain-free cave or some other kind of shelter, so\nI had never even entertained the possibility before. I had probably slipped into a river or something. Rivers don’t exist\nindoors, so maybe it was some kind of underground creek in this cave I was\nin…? Up to now, I had been careful with every step I took, making sure\neverything remained steady in the darkness.

If I survived this, I was\n\ngonna give myself what for. Of course, given my personality, I doubted I’d\nlearn anything from it. It was funny how serenely I was handling this whole thing, though. Not\nlike I had much in the form of arms or legs I could flail about in horrified\npanic…\nGuess it’s over, then. Pretty short lifetime—even by slime standards,\nmaybe. I said my final prayers, awaiting my inevitable suffocation. ………\n……\n…\nSuffocation never came. Why not?\n\nDid I not fall in the water? Time to call on the Sage, maybe.\n\nReceived. A slime’s body operates exclusively on magicules. Oxygen is\nunnecessary, and therefore, so is breathing. That is why you have not been\nengaging in that behavior. Oh… Right. I wasn’t paying attention, but I guess there wasn’t any\nbreathing, was there? Made sense. Even after ninety days, I was still\nlearning something new! But now wasn’t the time to celebrate. I had fallen into water, and even if\nI wouldn’t die, it did still put me in kind of a bind. What now? I couldn’t\nreally tell whether I was floating or sinking. My lack of limbs precluded\nany attempt at swimming. Would I wind up at the bottom sooner or later\nand be able to creep my way back to the surface? Or was I doomed to bob\naround in the middle of the current, never reaching much of anywhere? Though, if anything, it felt less like a violent torrent and more like I was\nbeing rocked in a cradle. Very gently rocked. It felt pretty good, even…\nSomething told me this wasn’t flowing water after all. Maybe it was a\nlake, not a river. I didn’t feel as though I was being taken anywhere. I was\njust kind of bobbing up and down, like a plastic bag, and it didn’t feel as if\nI’d ever hit bottom. If things stayed this way, I was in big trouble. What now?

So I started drinking, filling my Predator stomach up to approximately\n10 percent of its capacity. Then, I expelled it like I was wringing out my\nstomach. The sense of release was exhilarating. Suddenly, I heard a voice in my mind:\nWater Pressure Propulsion skill acquired. It was the first time I recognized it. This had to be the so-called World\nLanguage. There was no mistaking it, since the Sage spoke only when\nspoken to, but the two voices did sound exactly the same. But I didn’t have a moment to ponder over this. The more pressure I\napplied on the water, the more pressure I felt on myself, and I was rocketing\nforward at astonishing speed, as if I was about to launch myself into the\nsky. The acceleration was intense. Honestly, maybe it was a good thing I\ncouldn’t see. Instead, I just basked in the sensation of my body zipping\nalong through the darkness. Well, let me clarify. If I could’ve seen my surroundings, I’m sure the\nfear would’ve been intense…but not being able to see was just as terrifying. If you’ve ever been on a roller coaster in an amusement park in total\ndarkness, perhaps you’d understand the feeling. My mind flashed back to\nmy previous life and the single day I spent visiting a certain paradise under\nthe rule of a certain rodent. At least his magical dreamland offered safety\nharnesses. By this point, I wanted to punch myself for coming up with the idea. And trying it out right after thinking it up? Come on, man! What happened\nto some kind of, you know, preliminary safety check? The terror was starting to affect my train of thought. How long would I\nkeep accelerating? How much water did I spit out, anyway? As that thought occurred to me, I felt my body crash headlong into\nsomething and bounce off it. I braced myself for a wave of paralyzing pain. Which never came.\n\nHuh?

You have acquired Cancel Pain, which interrupts the creation\nof pain. Your Resist Melee Attack has reduced the amount of damage taken. The amount of damage your body has incurred is ten percent. The intrinsic\nslime skill Self-Regeneration has taken effect. Would you like to support it\nwith your Predator unique skill? Yes\nNo\nOh, so I was hurt a little, then?\n\nMade sense. I wasn’t sure whether this\nwas a good or bad thing, but as long as I knew something was up, then\nmaybe I didn’t need to feel pain after all. It’d make certain things easier. Predator support, though, huh?\n\nI don’t really get it, but sure. “Yes.”\nAt that moment, I was greeted with the feeling that I had suddenly lost\nsome of my body mass. After a while, I felt it return. My damaged parts had\nbeen Predated, analyzed, and repaired. Talk about a useful body to have. I\nshould try testing later to see how much of it I can afford to lose before I’m\nKO’d. It was way too dangerous to mess with in detail, but I guess I could\nafford to go without at least a bit of it at a time, so…\nSomething told me I was getting a little too careful, anyway. I had a\nstockpile of recovery potions, which I didn’t even have to use. And I\nwould’ve figured losing a tenth of my body would be a pretty serious issue,\nbut now I knew I could just regenerate it in the space of ten seconds.

Next were the “magic-born people”—the catchall term for those who\n\ncame into being from magic itself, monsters who experienced sudden\nmutation, and sentient beings evolved from animals or magical beasts. They\nhad both intelligence and reproductive ability, but only within their own\nsubspecies. In their upper social castes existed titans, vampires, devils, and\nother longer-lived species—all equally capable of having offspring,\nalthough they rarely did so, since their overwhelming magic force caused\nthem to be nigh immortal, obviating the need to leave descendants. These diverse intelligent, reproducing species were hostile to mankind\nand collectively referred to as the “magic-born race.” And reading between\nthe lines, the impression I got was that the magic-born weren’t so much\novertly hostile toward humans as the humans feared and coveted their\npowers. It remained true, though, that both sides were fighting for their own\nliving spaces. These sundry monsters had been classified by levels of danger. The\nupper ranks of the magic-born were packed with some pretty powerful\nbuggers—all capable of leveling a human town solo if they felt like it. Not\nthe kinds of guys you’d want to hang around.

None have succeeded in traveling to another world from here,\nbut there are more than a few that have completed their travels here from\nelsewhere. They are known as “visitors,” or “otherworlders,” and they\nbear knowledge of things that do not exist in this world. They acquire, as I\nhear it, some manner of special power when they make the journey here. Beyond that, there are records of transmigrants, who—as I said—bear\nknowledge of other worlds. Not all of them choose to openly identify\nthemselves as such, though, I imagine. Interesting. I didn’t know whether they came from the same planet I did,\nbut it might be good to chat with them a bit. There might even be some\nfrom Japan, for all I knew. It was probably best for my sanity to have a goal\nwhile I was here, besides. I see, I see! In that case, I think I’ll try and track down some of these\n“otherworlders,” as you called them.

Maybe I could use my knowledge of Earth to harness\nthis “Magic Sense” thing to figure out what the world around me was like…\nWorth a shot, I guessed. This blindness was getting to be a massive pain. Plus, I had the Sage on my side. It could work this out. I’m ready to learn, sir! Now, now, no need for such ardor. It is quite simple. First, try moving\nthe magic around you with the force in your body. I had an inkling of what he meant. It was the skill I’d probably adapted\nto blow myself out of the water a moment ago. Like this? I tensed up, trying to imagine the strength circulating through my body. I\ncould feel something moving within—the magicules my companion was\ntalking about. I hadn’t been conscious of it in the water, but it looked as\nthough I could adjust the force by how much I tensed up. Before, I hadn’t\nbeen controlling the water so much as I was controlling the magic dancing\naround in it. I was exercising my magical muscles, and the particles around\nme were reacting. It came to me surprisingly quickly. Mmm. You are more gifted in this than I thought. Now, do you see the\ndifference between the magic moving within you and that outside of your\n\nbody? Whoa. Maybe this actually was easy. Maybe I was more sensitive to the\nmagic I absorbed now that I was conscious of the way I lived off it. Well, sure!

Heh-heh-heh!\n\nIf you understand that much, the rest is child’s play. All it\ntakes is feeling the movements of the particles outside of you. Yeah, that I didn’t get. But I gave it a shot, doing as I was told and\nfeeling out the particles surrounding me. And I found I could. I could sense them hanging in the air, riding air currents, moving around\n—all sorts of sensations. Let’s ask the Sage about this. Confirmed. Extra skill “Magic Sense”…successfully acquired. Use the\nextra skill Magic Sense? Yes\nNo\nHuh?\n\nIt was that easy? Well, sure—yes, then… Man, talk about a rock I can rely on! The moment I invoked Magic Sense, my brain was filled with new\ninformation. A massive amount, something my human brain never could’ve\nprocessed—the waves of light and sound pushing every single tiny particle\naround—and I processed it all, converting it into perceptible data. The thing about human eyesight is that it doesn’t give you even a 180degree view of what’s in front of you. Now, all of a sudden, I could “see” a\nfull 360 degrees around myself. The shadows of the rocks around me, the\nviews hundreds of meters away—the moment I turned my attention to it, I\ncould figure out what it was. If I were still human, all this perception data\nprobably would’ve fried my brain circuits. But now I was a slime. My cells\ncould provide muscle just as easily as brain power.

Since I had it,\nthough… No problem. Oh, I think I’ve got it. Thank you very much! I said, turning my attention\nto the creature in front of me. Holy crap. He really was a dragon. He was covered in scales that shone\na dark shade of black, tougher looking than steel itself but supple and\nflexible. A big, evil-looking…\nGahh! You’re a dragon!! He looked positively demonic, towering far higher than I anticipated. My internal scream welled up, pouring out of me, and I don’t think I could\nreally be blamed for it. What a surprise. I feel bad for ever thinking this guy was pet sized. This\nwas…for real.\n\nAbsolutely no doubt. The body, startlingly similar to a Western-style dragon’s, shone like\nobsidian. There were six fingers on each “hand,” equipped with claws that\nlooked ready to tear through whatever they found.

I began regretting being so rude back when I couldn’t take\nit all in, but that was all water under the bridge. Turned out, by the way, that I was indeed oval shaped. Like a little bun. Kind of a…light turquoise, maybe? Lighter than the daylight sky, but not by\na lot. A rather elegant color, I thought. Shame about the whole being-aslime thing. You do remember your promise, yes? And considering your previous\ncomplaints, you learned rather quickly, no? Oh, of course! I was just joking a little, is all. I can see just fine, and\nplus I can hear now, too. I really appreciate this!\n\nHmph. You could have taken your time…\nSo he was fine after all. A little scary looking, but he was awfully kind\nto me, for no good reason. He really was lonely, I imagined. It was\nunfortunate that he looked the way he did. Kind of like that little story about\nthe poor red demon who wanted to befriend the humans. So what do you intend to do next? Well, for starters, I figure I might as well look for some otherworlders\nfrom my home country. Not that I care too much if I don’t, but…you know.

Magic was\n\none thing, but I doubted there was a sword or lance in this or any other\nworld that could scratch him. It wasn’t as if I knew that much of this world\nyet—maybe it was crawling with horrifying monsters even more powerful\nthan him, or something? Was your opponent that tough? She was…quite strong. She was what the humans call a “hero,” one\nblessed with so-called divine protection. A hero? My days in front of a game console had made me well familiar\nwith that term. Simply doing hero stuff didn’t make you dragon-slaying\nmaterial, though. A lot of recent games had turned their so-called “heroes”\ninto foils or parodies of themselves, besides. Maybe things were still a bit\nmore traditional around here. Now that I recall, Veldora continued, the hero also said she was\n“summoned.” Perhaps she hails from the same area as you. Oh? I dunno… Where I come from, nobody’s that strong, you know? Perhaps, but many otherworlders come here bearing special powers. Powers that are chiseled into their souls in the midst of their journey. The\nsummoned will always bear one such skill—a unique skill, one exclusive to\nthem and them alone. Unlike the otherworlders who come here by sheer\naccident, these people bear a soul strong enough to withstand the stress of\nthe summoning process. The fact that said summoning process so rarely\nsucceeds in this world otherwise proves as much. When you say “summoning process,” do you mean…magic, or\nwhatever? Precisely. A process requiring at least thirty magicians conducting a\nceremony that takes place over three days. It is rarely successful, but it is\nseen as a powerful weapon to have in one’s arsenal, should the need arise. A weapon? Mm. Those summoned in such a manner are bound by a magical curse\nupon their soul, unable to resist the orders of their masters. Whoa, really?\n\nNo human rights or anything? Human rights?

So are you saying that otherworlders pretty much get treated like slaves\n\nhere? No.\n\nIt depends. There is no Domination Stamp applied to them. If society\naccepts them, they are free to live their lives as they please. They can\nbecome adventurers or the like. Many otherworlder adventurers have\nsought my head… They learned the error of their ways soon enough! Hyaaa-ha-ha-ha-ha!! So you’re only forced into servitude if you were summoned here, huh…? Not “servitude,” exactly, but I suppose so, yes. I like to believe I know a\ngreat deal about the humans, but “a great deal” is not everything. No… You’re a dragon, besides. In way, he knew almost too much as a dragon. At least conversing\ntogether put me on his good side—enough that he answered all my\nquestions. So we kept talking—Veldora and I, dragon and slime, about all\nsorts of things. How had the fight gone with this hero? How strong was she? Her skin was pale in color, the dragon told me; her lips were bright red\nand small. Her long hair was a dark shade of silver, kept back in a single\nponytail. She was slim, not that tall, rather small for a human. Her face was apparently covered by a mask, but there was no doubting\nher beauty. I asked him whether this beauty was enough to distract him,\nwhether he was too enrapt to defend himself properly. Enough of your\nnonsense! he bellowed back at me. Apparently she carried a long, curved sword. A “katana,” it was called. She didn’t bother with a shield. Taking advantage of two unique skills—\nAbsolute Severance and Unlimited Imprisonment—and a wealth of other\nmagic, she, as Veldora put it, “overwhelmed” him. There was more than a\ntrace of nostalgic contentment in his voice, or so it seemed to me.\n\nSomething I picked up on as we spoke was that this dragon… I think he\nreally liked humans.

It would have been one\nthing if it had been a cute girl sitting next to me at the movie theater, but it\nwas quite another when it was a death-dealing mythical beast. Not fun. Pretty funny, though.

The chance of\ndestroying the prison by physically damaging it is zero. Cannot analyze an\nescape route involving the annulment of imaginary space. One would need\nto be caught within the same Unlimited Imprisonment situation in order to\nanalyze it from the inside. This is currently impossible. The chance of escaping in spiritual form is one percent. If a spiritual receptacle is prepared for the target on the outside to aid in\nthe transition, the success rate is three percent. This process is equivalent to\ntransmigration. If the target is poorly compatible with the receptacle, he\nwill lose all memories and abilities. This concludes the report on potential escape routes. —Hmm.\n\nKind of low numbers, it sounds like. Unlimited Imprisonment\nlooked like nothing more than a transparent membrane from my\nperspective…but physical damage did nothing against it? Maybe it had\nsome kind of insurmountable defense attached to it, for all I knew. Hey, did you lay any damage on this hero at all? Or vice versa?\n\nAh, I am glad you asked!

I’d just be\nhurting Veldora further if I dampened his spirits. Mm? There is a way out of here?! Indeed… I feel my magical force will\nexhaust itself by no later than a hundred years from now. My magic\ncontinues to flow out of me, even now. Yeah?\n\nSo that’s why there’s such a concentration of it around here…\nIndeed. Even high-class monsters would not dare approach. You saw\nhow there were no weeds on the ground? The sort of plants that can thrive\nin this area are very rare indeed! Right. I recalled all the hipokute herbs I’d churned through over my\nshort life. It was that valuable, huh? Yeah, so…you wanna try escaping, maybe? If I had the right receptacle,\nI think that’d help our chances a fair amount… Do you know what I’d need,\nthough? …Indeed, even if I escaped in spiritual form only, it would be quite\ndifficult to regather magic and form my core once more.

As I said, I am both unique and the most perfect of my kind. A fully unique creation, one that takes purely spiritual form. I have no\nparticular attachment to this body. It is merely the faith of those who live\naround me that forms the shape you see. There he went again. Spouting off complete nonsense. As far as I could piece together in the ensuing conversation, the basic\nidea went like this:\nUsing his consciousness alone, he could gather magicules toward him to\nform a physical body. Said body was currently being held in this prison, but\nthat prison also prevented his will from collecting the magic he needed. Could he escape in consciousness form alone? No, because he needed some\nkind of receptacle. If he simply burst out in spirit form, his essence would scatter to the\nwinds like the magic itself, erasing his very existence. This would result in\nthe birth of a new storm dragon, somehow, somewhere—I didn’t care about\nthe details by this point. But to sum up, maybe he could escape, but if he\ndid, he’d wind up being something else. It wouldn’t matter to him.\n\nSo much for that. But what if I used Predator to consume Veldora\nhimself? I could either analyze him inside my stomach, or isolate him and\nannul the effect of Unlimited Imprisonment, and he’d be out. Would that\nwork? Received: It is possible to store the target Veldora in your stomach via\nthe unique skill Predator. Really…?\n\nIn that case, if I could convince him of it, we could get going. If I couldn’t, he’d have another century of isolation before he was reduced\nto nonexistence. So I spent a few moments explaining the Predator skill to\nVeldora, and what I wanted to do with it. It’d be impossible from the get-go\nwithout the Sage’s help, but…\nMwah-hah-hah-hah-hah! Fascinating! Please, go ahead. I leave myself\nat your mercy! You’re that ready to believe me? But of course!

It was the only way to describe the reaction when the disappearance of\nthe storm dragon Veldora was confirmed. It wasn’t every day that a Special\nS-ranked monster simply vanished without a trace.\n\nMonsters, as well as adventurers, were ranked on a system of six grades,\nfrom A to F. Pluses and minuses could be attached to these grades for extra\nprecision. This system was first put into place by a man named Yuuki\nKagurazaka, a rumored otherworlder and one of the few to assume the\ntopmost rank of “grand master” in the Free Guild. It was quickly adopted,\nthanks to being much easier to understand than the previous, somewhat\narbitrary four-tier system of “novice” → “beginner” → “intermediate” →\n“advanced.”\nThe Special S rank combined the S rank, which comprised demon lord–\nclass foes that deserved more than simply an A, with the “Special” tag\nreserved for those above even that class—monsters capable of singlehandedly engineering calamities or natural disasters. A scale-breaking rank,\nexisting wholly outside the six traditional ones.\n\nNormally, an A-ranked\nmonster alone would be dreadful enough to threaten the existence of a\nnation—someone like Veldora was dangerous enough to plunge it into\ndespair. Three hundred years of penance had done nothing to affect the dragon’s\nrank as a natural disaster–level threat. Just because he had disappeared\ndidn’t mean he couldn’t be reborn somewhere, posing a new menace before\nlong. But twenty days after the initial report of his disappearance, the Western\nHoly Church issued a report that, as far as its investigations could tell,\nVeldora the Storm Dragon both no longer existed and showed no sign of\nexisting anytime soon. Word spread first in the area around the Forest of Jura, a broad plain\ndotted with a large number of minor countries. Once Veldora’s fate had\nbeen broadly reported, each one of them sprang to their feet, the proverbial\nhornet’s nest stimulated to action. Every king and every minister of every\nnation held day after day of emergency meetings, gathering information and\ndebating what to do next. It was a trying time for the Baron of Veryard, minister of the small\nkingdom of Blumund, but not half as trying as it was for the man Veryard\nhad called into his private chamber that day.

He\nwas the guild master for this kingdom, a position affording him a hefty\namount of authority even in such a tiny nation.\n\n“I believe you know why I summoned you here,” the baron began the\nmoment Fuze walked through the archway. “You have heard about the\nstorm dragon by now, have you not?”\nFuze nodded. “Of course, my baron,” he said in his low, hoarse voice. “Hmph,” Veryard spat out in response. “I suppose I should expect\nnothing less of you, my good guild master. Now, may I ask about how the\nguild intends to respond?”\n“We have no particular plans at this time, sir.”\n“…I’m sorry, did I hear you correctly? You have no intention to take\naction?”\n“Yes, sir,” Fuze replied with a voice devoid of emotion, silently asking\nthe baron what he was so perturbed about. “I do not feel any action is\nnecessary.”\nThe baron, not a great fan of this response, chose to keep those feelings\nhidden. “Rather a strange thing to say, is it not?\n\nNot necessary? The\ndisappearance of Veldora the Storm Dragon may portend further monster\nactivity in the space of days, even hours! And you are taking no measure at\nall against it?”\n“It would strike me as rather strange to do so, sir, for taking such\nmeasures is the job of the state. I am responsible for the Free Guild, not for\nproviding volunteer work when bidden.”\nThis was the truth, as far as Fuze was concerned. The Free Guild was an\nindependent, nongovernmental agency. Its members were afforded no\nspecial guarantees of security or comfort—unlike the assorted workers and\ncraftsmen on the government ledger—but the basic rights that all citizens\nwere entitled to. Their only official debt to the kingdom came in the form of\ntaxes. That was the system in Blumund, as it was in nearly all the nations that\nsurrounded it. To put it another way, the Free Guild was a group that\noperated outside the framework of any nation—and one far more unified\nthan a single government as well. It was a fact that some of their operations\noccurred without the knowledge or consent of these nations, whether the\nguild intended it to be seen that way or not. “Is it not the responsibility of the state,” the guild master meekly\ncontinued, “to protect the assets of its people? In the same way, it is the\nguild’s responsibility to protect the lives of its members. We both have a lot\non our plates, I suppose.”", "token_len": 687, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

We both have a lot\non our plates, I suppose.”\n\nFuze wasn’t sure whether he had imagined the blue vein that had just\npopped up on Veryard’s forehead or not. He hadn’t.\n\nThe baron knew his position was being probed. “Enough pretense, Guild Master! How many mercenaries can you\nprovide us? How many adventurers with combat experience? What is the\nsize of the defense force you can provide in service? I need numbers!”\nThe guild master gave a roll of his eyes and sighed. “I do hope we are on\nthe same page when I say this, sir, but I will remind you, we are not an\narmy of volunteers. If we are talking about a mobilization based on the\nterms of our agreement, I can provide you the equivalent of one-tenth of our\nmembers. If you wish access to anything beyond that, well, that would all\ndepend on our compensation.”\nThe population of Blumund was almost exactly one million. The\nmembership log of the local Free Guild totaled around seven thousand,\nfamily members not included. Thus, if the kingdom decided to invoke its\nagreement with the guild and muster 10 percent of its members—seven\nhundred in all—these fighters would officially join the command of the\nnational army. Such an order, of course, would apply only to guild members who\nbelonged to Blumund and no other nation. All Free Guild members fell\nunder the same banner, but their home nations were also clearly stated in\nthe logs for this reason. What’s more, while a nation had the right to define\nits own mobilization period under this agreement, it was also obliged to\ngive the guild a one-fifth discount on taxes collected during the entire\nperiod. This allowed governments to rapidly summon a powerful force, and\nthe guild to make sure its men would not be obligated to the state for too\nmuch of their time. For a group like the guild, which was required to pay\nsalaries to all deployed members in advance, it was the obvious approach to\ntake. Besides, even if a government asked for every man the local Free Guild\nhad, there would be no way to handle them. After all, only about half of any\nguild’s membership had any fighting skill. The Blumund nobles were fully aware of this. Normally, they wouldn’t\nhave their top minister attempt to bully the guild master into better terms…\n\nbut the times demanded otherwise.

The monsters were stirring, for one—\nbut even beyond that, they had more pressing motivations. “Very well.\n\nEnough of this. Are you trying to wring the truth out of me,\nFuze?”\nFuze’s eyebrows raised a little at the mention of his name. Veryard\nrarely, if ever, called him by it. He turned his eyes toward the baron for the\nfirst time. “The area near Veldora’s prison was meant to be absolutely\nimpenetrable,” he said. “Now that route may potentially be open to direct\nnavigation—and that means we must consider the possibility of the Eastern\nEmpire taking action.”\n“Ah, certainly so!” the baron replied. “Whether they were letting\nVeldora be or were simply afraid of the seal being broken, we have been\ndetecting sudden new movements in the Empire after a long period of\nsilence. Do you understand what that means?\n\nIf they can navigate that\nforest, this kingdom will be swallowed up instantly. And we can forget\nabout the Western Holy Church providing us any meaningful support! The\ncountries around the Forest of Jura have no meaningful alliance with each\nother. We will all become Empire vassals in the blink of an eye!”\n“No support from the Church…? I fear not, no. They never were terribly\ninterested in wars between mere mortals in the first place. Annihilating the\nmonsters is what their doctrine calls for.”\n“Quite so. If we could have them deploy even one of their paladins, the\nEmpire wouldn’t be so quick to move… Not needing to prepare for monster\nattacks would buy us some time, at least.”\n“I doubt anything could stir the Church to action,” Fuze said. “The\ndestruction of a nation or two does nothing to affect their own finances. They cannot help everyone, nor even their own flock.” He took a moment\nto gauge the baron’s face. Veryard looked exhausted, as if he had aged\nrapidly in just the past few days. It was understandable. The two of them were childhood friends. And even though Veryard was\nmerely a baron, if the public knew of Fuze’s close contact with a member of\nthe nobility, it would create assorted difficulties for the both of them. They\nboth had to pretend to use each other for their own personal gain, which\nwas why they usually portrayed their relationship as surly and resentful.

It would take more than the power of a small kingdom to overcome this\nthorny obstacle they now faced. But perhaps, Fuze thought, his friend was\n\nbeing overly anxious. The Empire was on the move, it was true, but that\ndidn’t mean they should expect an attack before sunset. “But how do we know the Empire will take action against us?” he\noffered. “I will gladly conduct my own personal inquiries into the matter. I’d advise you not to expect much, but I can at least gauge the situation in\nthe Forest of Jura and around the Empire.”\n“…I would appreciate that.”\nYes. There was no guarantee the Empire would act against them. If it\nwas going to, it would undoubtedly be with a large force. It was never a\nnation to waste its time with small skirmishes. No, it would casually send\nover a force of a million or so and trample over every nation in the area, one\nby one. Assembling such an army would take time, at least three years or\nso.\n\nWhich was not a generous amount, but it created some wiggle room to\nwork with. “I had best begin gathering information, then,” Fuze said to close the\nconversation. “There is little time. I am off!”\n“Thank you…”\nThe two of them nodded and went their separate ways. There was much\nto do. Thirty days had passed since I swallowed Veldora. What had I been up to?\n\nWell, think about it. If you were being attacked by a monster, what would\nyou do? I mean, I was a slime now. It would be hard for me to zip away from a\nslavering attacker, much less defend myself. So I’d been spending my time\nthinking about how to fight back. Along the way, I’d also been consuming any particularly odd-looking\nherbs or glowing rocks I stumbled across. There was a fair amount. I was\nstill in the region Veldora described as teeming with local magic, and nearly\neverything I found there was hipokute herbs. Which was about what I\nfigured. More healing potions for me, I suppose. I also found that most of the glowing stones and such around here were\nwhat was called “magic ore,” which could supposedly be refined into a\nmetal harder than iron or steel and highly compatible with magic.

I shouldn’t be too greedy.\n\nSo as I was chowing down on all these yummy herbs and rock, an idea\ncame to mind! If I could spit out water fast enough to give me powers of flight, maybe I\ncould slice right through foes, too, like a high-pressure water jet cutter? No, no, I know what you’re thinking.\n\nYou’re thinking I was about to\nscrew it up again, aren’t you? You really shouldn’t look down on people\nlike that. I was good in a pinch, you know. They always wrote that in my\nreport cards at school and stuff—“excellent work when he applies himself.”\nSo yeah, I think it’d work. Back I went to the underground lake from before. Just as I had\nimagined, the pool was pretty big. The air felt supremely tranquil to me. There were no creatures around—not even in the water, I assumed, what\nwith all the magic soaked up inside it—which made it all the quieter. Pure,\nunadulterated nature! Truly a sight to see. But back to business. I moved right into the “action” phase last time\nwithout testing a single thing, which was fairly ill-advised. That, and I\nejected too much water at once, propelling myself far quicker than intended. No game plan whatsoever. This time, I’d keep it at water-pistol level,\nexpelling just a bit at a time. Just taking a mouthful of water and—thpbbt—\nspitting it out. Here I go. Hmm. Not much water coming out. Too small of an exit hole? I\nexpanded it a bit. Water shot out with a little more energy this time, dousing\na nearby boulder I was targeting. A promising sign. After a few more minutes spent adjusting my water levels, I decided to\nboost the pressure just a tad more before opening wide. Launch. Then\nagain.

I thought to myself as I took a dip into the lake to gather\nmy thoughts. Whenever I was tired, that was my cue to hit the bath for a bit. I wasn’t just splashing around for kicks, all right? Besides, it also gave me a\nchance to use Magic Sense and observe myself floating and sinking in the\nwater. I reminded myself of a jellyfish, kind of. Maybe I could vibrate my body’s surface to create currents or\nsomething? I gave it a shot, running magical force across my “skin” to\ncontrol the particles around me. The vibration ran across my entire body, so\nI tried to point it in a single direction—and that was all it took to get me\nmoving. Nice!\n\nI spent a little while whizzing around the water like that, enjoying\nthe experience. A nice change of pace, to be sure, but I totally wasn’t just\nmessing around, all right? Let’s keep that straight. Skill “Current Movement” acquired. I thought it was the Sage for a moment, but it turned out to be the World\nLanguage instead. That bit of playing around just earned me a new skill. Oh, but it wasn’t playing around, okay? I was just relaxing a bit. Thanks to that, though, I could now flit around in or on the water at a\npretty decent clip. If need be, I could use Water Pressure Propulsion to\nspeed things up, too. Considering I didn’t need to breathe, fighting in the\nwater might actually give me an advantage, for all I knew. Good for fleeing\ninto, at least. That and other matters like it were on my mind as I left the lake. Break\ntime was over, and it had certainly borne fruit for me.\n\nAs I was relaxing, I\nhad come up with a few new concepts. If I was going to keep pursuing the water-gun approach, I’d have to\napply constant pressure to my jet output for an extended period of time. Instead, I decided to picture the cylinder of a car engine, applying pressure\nto my inside while releasing a comparatively small amount of water per go. Adjusting the pressure and the diameter of my output hole allowed me to\nadjust the force of expulsion, just like before. And thankfully, just as I’d hoped, it worked.

A small jet, ejected sharply\n\nout of my body, slapped itself against the boulder—and it actually broke the\nrock slightly where it hit. Success…I think. Better keep practicing before I forget the knack. Adjust\noutput diameter, adjust pressure…and try putting a bit of spin on the water\nas you eject it, too. There was a lot to think about as I kept rehearsing it. But that was it! That was the mental picture I had to keep in mind. Slicing through with water. I had to make the jets as thin and flat as\npossible, applying just the right spin to them. So I gave it a whirl. And it worked! The cylindrical shot of water fought\nthrough the air resistance fast enough to leave afterimages, just like a\nblade…then slashed its way right through the rock. With enough force to\nastound even me. It was the pinnacle of my efforts, the best results of my week of practice. Skill “Water Blade” acquired.

Where were we supposed to go? It was burning all around us…\nI—Shizue Izawa—felt myself teetering on the brink of desperation. Ahh… Is this where I’m going to die…? Even at the age of eight, I understood that well enough. I had no\nrelatives I could rely on; I lived alone with my mother. My father had been\ndrafted into the war so long ago that I didn’t even remember what he looked\nlike. I was never quite sure whether I should be happy or sad about that, but\neither way, it had become my normal life, and I had to accept it for what it\nwas. Me, and my life, and my fate to die in the flames. And then—\n“You want to live? If you want to live, heed my voice!”\n—a voice echoed in my head. Did I want to live? How should I know? I was too young to answer that\nquestion. Still, though…\nLooking at my mother, now just a pair of hands after she had shielded\nme with her body, I couldn’t stop the tears from coming.

I was no\nlonger capable of forming a coherent sentence, but if I had to summarize\nmy thoughts, I suppose they’d be along the lines of this:\nYou called for me, you gave up on me… I can’t believe you ignored me! That’s cruel! In the end, it was another demonic whim that saved me. His eyes eerily\nlit up once more. “Heh. A liar, eh?” he whispered. “One moment…”\nThe ominous reply filled me with anxiety—but my near-fatal burns left\nme with nothing else to do. All I could do was prostrate myself before the\nwill of this monster, this Leon. “I had thought you were merely garbage,” he said, “but maybe you’re\nsuited for flame after all.” Then he activated the summoning spell for Ifrit,\nthe fire titan. It was easy for him.\n\nNo casting required at all. And when the\ngiant appeared, he tossed him a casual order:\n“I’m giving you a body. Use it well.”\nIt was all the evidence anyone needed to show that Leon treated me as\nless than human. My frustration began evolving into hatred.\n\nThe trauma\nwas etched into my mind at such a tender age. “You want to live? If you want to live, show me your will!”\nIt must have been my imagination. There was no way the demon lord\ncould have ever said anything like that to me. No way he could have\nextended a hand out to me just before I succumbed to my burns. But it was true: thanks to having my body possessed, I lived because of\nhim. The summoned Ifrit followed his orders, attempting to merge himself\nwith my young frame.

It must have been thinking that it had stunned me into silence,\nthat I was unable to move. Probably coming up with ways to land the final\nstrike on me. Maybe it found the concept of swallowing me whole to be too\nbland or something. Well, no point holding back. Without another moment’s hesitation, I\nsquared up toward the snake’s neck and unleashed a Water Blade. With a\nlethal-sounding fwissh, the blade pierced through the air and struck the\nmonster. It all happened in an instant—so quick, I doubted my eyes. Without a\nsingle bit of resistance, the Water Blade lopped the black snake’s head off. A snake so huge, so ominous looking, I was sure I’d be nothing but a\nmidafternoon snack to it. This skill…might have been a tad stronger than I thought. If I’d used it\non that adventuring trio, things might’ve gone all slasher film pretty fast. Good thing I’d had the foresight to try it on a monster first. Before I go on, let’s do a quick recap of what was occupying my\nstomach at the moment. Veldora, 15 percent. Water, 10 percent. Medicinal\nherbs, recovery potions, and the like, 2 percent. Ore and other materials, 3\npercent. Grand total, about 30 percent in use. Each Water Blade strike used\nnot even a regular cup’s worth of water, so…sheesh, I could probably spit\nout thousands of these before I even began worrying about running out. Hell of a lot more efficient than some stupid magic spell. I think I’ll be\nrelying on this against monsters for a while to come. So about this snake. Would it have any abilities I could steal by\nabsorbing and analyzing it? No time to waste.\n\nLet’s give it a shot.\n\nThe results were…not bad.

No time to waste.\n\nLet’s give it a shot.\n\nThe results were…not bad. In addition to the ability to disguise myself\nas a black snake, I gained the following two skills:\n\nSense Heat Source:Intrinsic skill. Identifies any heat reactions in the\nlocal area. Not affected by any concealing effects. Poisonous Breath:Intrinsic skill. A powerful breath-type poison\n(corrosion) attack. Affects an area seven meters in\nfront of the user in a 120-degree radius. It looked as if this poison had a corrosive effect on its target, damaging\nwhatever equipment or flesh it touched. A normal adventurer would\nprobably have a lot of trouble against this guy, wouldn’t they? Though who\ncould say, really, given the kind of magic available in this world. I spent a little while analyzing the skills of this snake I’d just\nvanquished. The more cards in my hand, the better, I figured.\n\nThe results:\n1. Mimicking the black snake increased my bodily volume. 2. The skills I’d just earned could be invoked without having to\nmimic the snake’s form, although their performance could suffer\nas a result. To go into further detail:\n1. I could break down and store the monsters I consumed with\nPredator in my stomach. I’d used Predator on my own body in\norder to repair damage, and this provided some spare cells to\nhelp with that, in other words. 2. “Intrinsic skills” appeared to be skills that were exclusive to a\ncertain type of monster. My Absorb, Self-Regeneration, and\nDissolve skills were intrinsic to me as a slime. However, to use\nintrinsics, I needed to take the form of the monster in question,\nor else I couldn’t bust them out all the way. I could still use them\nin part, though, and some skills—like Sense Heat Source—\nseemed to work just fine either way. Putting it all together: Predator freakin’ rocked.\n\nI couldn’t wait to track\ndown some other useful skills with this thing. Three days had passed after my snake battle. I was still in the cave. I\ncouldn’t feel heat or cold or anything, but for all I knew, it was pretty chilly\n\nin here. I had yet to see a single ray of sunshine, but my vision still worked just\nfine in the dark.

It looked as if that adventuring trio\nknew where the hell they were going, didn’t it? I’d be fine. It was probably just a really long path. Not knowing the\nexact way did make me a little nervous, though. Was there any way to get\nsome help with that?\n\nReceived. Display the paths you’ve currently taken in your brain? Yes\nNo\nPfft. I laughed at myself. Are you kidding me?! I thought, unable to resist\na little whining. If I had something like that, why didn’t you tell me sooner?! Of course I immediately picked “Yes.” I used to think automapping was\ncheating once, too, but now I knew the error of my ways. With older games,\nyou were expected to bring your own pencil and graph paper, filling in the\nsquares with every step you took in the dungeon. That was what made them\nfun—making sure you were on the right track with every single step you\ntook. As time passed, though, people became more reliant on strategy\nguides, and games started to be shipped with their own built-in mapping\nfeatures. It sucked all the real fun out of the genre, you could say—but once\nyou got used to the convenience, there was no turning back. What I’m trying to say is…you know, if you’ve got such a powerful\nfeature at your fingertips, you might as well use it, right? Besides, this\nwasn’t a game. It was real life. I scoped out the map that flashed into my mind. Am I reading this right? It looks like I’ve been circling through the same\narea over and over again…\n………\n……\n\n…\nFollowing the map in my brain, I delved into a branch of the cave I’d\nnever bothered trying before.

I gotta hand it to the thing. (And my lack of direction was not the issue, all right?!)\nI must have been getting close to the entrance—to the great outdoors. Moss and weeds were starting to appear on the walls and ground. And I\ndidn’t know where the sun was, but the light, dim as it was, was starting to\nmake its way inside. Which meant it was daytime. Along the way, I had a few more monster encounters. To be exact:\nA centipede monster (“evil centipede,” rank B-plus)\nA big spider (“black spider,” rank B)\nA vampire bat (“giant bat,” rank C-plus)\nA big shelled lizard (“armorsaurus,” rank B-minus)\nNo more of those black snakes, though. Maybe that was the only one.\n\nThey were all pretty strong. Not that I’m one to talk, given that Water\nBlade was still enough to end a battle all by itself. But the bat guy did\ndodge my blades long enough to get a few bites in, and my attacks just\nbounced off the lizard guy’s body if I didn’t hit it at the right angle. They wouldn’t all go down easy. The centipede concealed itself long\nenough to attack me from behind, but between Magic Sense and Sense Heat\nSource, I had enough of a bead on my surroundings that I was fully\nprepared. One Water Blade tossed behind me was all it took to end that\nencounter. The spider, on the other hand. Oof. I always had a hang-up when it came to bugs in the first place. It was as\nif I was physically repulsed by them. Just one look was enough for me,\nthanks.

Five Water Blades at once, thrust\n\ndeep into its thorax. I didn’t want it in my sight for another moment. Not that it stopped me from consuming it afterward, though, nor any of\nthe other guys. Survival of the fittest and all. The spider and centipede gave\nme a little pause, yes, but I soldiered on. If any cockroach monsters showed up, though, I was definitely making a\nsprint for it. It wasn’t a matter of winning or losing.\n\nJust because I could\ndidn’t mean I always should. Between this and that, I managed to absorb quite a few monsters in this\ncave. Let’s go over the skills I acquired. Black snake: Poisonous Breath, Sense Heat Source\nCentipede: Paralyzing Breath\nBig spider: Sticky Thread, Steel Thread\nVampire bat: Drain, Ultrasonic Wave\nShelled lizard: Body Armor\nWhenever you get a new toy, you want to use it, right? Same here.\n\nSo I\nharnessed the Great Sage to research all the skills I picked up. Basically, I didn’t use Poisonous Breath from the snake. I actually\ntransformed so I could try it out against the lizard, and…like, whoa. All that\narmor didn’t do jack for the armorsaurus. It literally melted into a puddle of\ngoo before my eyes. Grossest thing I’d ever seen in my life, all those organs\nand bits of flesh all over the place. I had to spray another salvo of mist to\nbreak down the rest of the chewy bits. Last time I’d have to see that,\nhopefully. Really, this breath was almost too much of a force to be reckoned with. I\ndidn’t want to use it much, if possible. Sense Heat Source, though, was\nawesome. Pretty much every living creature emits heat. Combining this\nwith Magic Sense meant that I was all but impossible to ambush. There was\nno telling what kind of magic or special skills I’d run into once I started\ndealing with humans or intelligent high-level monsters, so I couldn’t afford\nto let my guard down. Next up, the centipede. I hardly wanted to mimic that guy, what with\nhow it looked and all. Its breath had about the same range as the black\nsnake’s, and its form was about the same size as well.

As I figured, trying to\n\nuse it in slime form limited the range to only about a meter. It could come in\nhandy for a surprise attack, I supposed, but if a foe was already within that\nradius, I’d be sunk unless I transformed or ran, so…\nThe lizard’s armor, as I mentioned, put up zero resistance whatsoever to\nPoisonous Breath. I couldn’t expect much from it.\n\nBesides, I already had\nResist Melee Attack, so there wasn’t much point. Using it in slime form just\nmade my external surface a bit tougher, kind of like the metallic slimes that\nshow up in that one RPG series and give you lots of EXP. It gave a nice\nmetal sheen to my light-turquoise body; whatever it did to me must’ve\nchanged the way the light reacted to my surface. I didn’t want to test how I\ntook damage with that on, though, so its effect remained a bit of a mystery. That little extra tint might help scare my foes into submission, though. That about wrapped up those three. The real meat, so to speak, lay in the\nother two. They were pretty darn fascinating. First, the spider. Who wouldn’t want to imitate that famous superhero\nwho does all the spidery stuff?\n\nFiring webs from his hands powerful enough\nto let him swing around skyscrapers, and all that? Sticky Thread, it seemed, was originally meant to let the user encase\ntheir prey in webs, rendering them immobile. But could I use it to do some\nfancy web-rope slinging of my own? Let’s try it. Point it at that tree branch,\nand…\nWhoosh! …Swiiiiiiing………\nSo, uh, on to Steel Thread. What? Sticky Thread? Never heard of it. Just some skill that leaves you\nhanging around motionless in the air. Pass. On to Steel Thread. I guess this is meant to block your foe’s attack. The spider uses it to help\nit create an effective (i.e., labyrinthine) web, the Sage told me. So I busted a\nthread out and whipped it against a tree. Whoosh! Snap! And lopped the trunk right off. With Magic Sense, I could tell that this Steel Thread would be extremely\ndifficult for the naked eye of a human to detect. If I worked with it a little, I\nbet it could be a decent weapon.

I spent a little time doing just that in case it\n\nwould come in handy later. Finally, the bat. To be honest, out of this entire zoo, I had the greatest\nexpectations for the bat. But—I mean, geez, Drain. If it hits, you could use 70 percent of your\ntarget’s skills for a limited period of time. Big whoop! Predator was far\nmore effective. Talk about a precipitous drop in quality. And what’s the\npoint of sucking someone’s blood when you can just analyze their data\ninstead? I’ll just toss that one aside. Ultrasonic Wave, on the other hand, piqued my interest. This skill had\nthe effect of confusing your foes or making them lose consciousness, but it\nwas originally used for echolocation. Just like bats back on my home\nplanet, you could use these sound waves to suss out exactly where you and\nother objects were positioned. But the skill didn’t matter to me. The sonic waves it emitted did. This\nslime was about to get his voice back. Talk about a stroke of luck. Instead\nof having to reinvent the wheel from the cells I had, I could just absorb a\nrelevant monster and take the skill for myself. Can I form it into a voice, though? That’s the tricky part.\n\nSo I continued\nmy research. Restlessly, forgoing all sleep (not that I needed it), I walked\naround for three days and three nights, testing it out. The end result:\n“I COME FROM OUTER SPACE!”\nPerfect! It was still a bit distorted, like someone tapping at their throat while\nyelling through a box fan, but it was definitely a voice! Now all I had to do\nwas fine-tune it! Trying my best to calm my excitement, I began the long, arduous voiceadjustment process. These supersonic waves were so useful.

There is a chance that the skill “Super Vibration” may be\n\nderived from “Ultrasonic Wave.” This cannot be acquired at this time. So I need to derive it or change the skill somehow? Not much to go on,\nbut nothing doing for now, I guess. Not like everything’s gonna be handed\nto me on a silver platter. Maybe I’m getting too greedy, but the more cards\nin your hand, right? No need to push things along too fast, though. Obtaining vocal cords is\na huge coup by itself. I should be happy with it. Looking back, I’d obtained a ton of skills in pretty short order as I\nwandered around, continuing with my research as I aimed for the exit. And while it took some time, I eventually made it. The outside. The first\ntime I got to bask in the sunlight of this world. Feels as if it’s been a while, going outside like this. It has been several\nmonths, come to think of it. Hopefully the light wouldn’t burn or melt me\nlike a vampire…although as a monster, I would reportedly have an\ninstinctual knowledge of what would be dangerous to my continued\nexistence. People do things they know are bad for them all the time, right?\n\nNo\njoke.\n\nWe could learn something from these monsters. The cave, it turned out, was in a forest. The exit was just a hole at the\nfoot of a mountain—more of a small hill, really, which stood out against the\nvast trees that surrounded it. In fact, thanks to the dense foliage, this hill\nwas the only point you could see the sun from. Take a step into the forest,\nand all appeared to be dim darkness again. Climbing to the top of the hill, I saw some kind of strange pattern carved\ninto it. A magical pentacle or something? Sure seemed like it. Maybe those\nadventurers I bumped into were responsible? Guess it doesn’t matter much. A wise man keeps away from danger, as they say. I sidled off.\n\nA fair amount of time had passed since I left the cave.

Is it this easy to\ndo stuff like that? This Sage is one heck of a personal assistant to have\naround. Anyway, it was now past four in the afternoon. About time to prep for\ndinner, but sadly, I no longer had to eat. I could, but the meaninglessness of\nthe gesture would probably just make me feel empty inside. So I kept messing around with the new skills I’d obtained from the\nmonsters I’d consumed in the cave. How to use them, neat ways to combine\nthem, whatever else I could do with them, et cetera. Speech was a particular\nfocus. That was what occupied my time as I continued down the path I’d\nfound. No particular destination. It would’ve been nice if there was a town\nor village with someone nice I could’ve talked to…but everything had been\nincredibly quiet over the past few days. After getting attacked so frequently\nin the cave, I hardly got any attention at all outdoors. Just once, while\npracticing my elocution, a pack of wolves started stalking me. I tried to\nthreaten them—“Ah?” I said—and that was all it took. “Yipe!” With pathetic yelps, they scampered away. We’re talking\nmultiple enormous canines, each easily two meters or so in length, and the\nsight of a slime freaked them out. Pathetic.\n\nNot that I minded being left alone. Getting a wolf’s sense of smell would\nbe neat, though. The reaction surprised me enough that I began paying closer attention to\nmy surroundings. Turned out it wasn’t just the wolves—not a single\nmonster out there dared get within several meters of me. Were they really\nthat scared? It sure seemed that way, but…like, why? As I thought over that, my Magic Sense skill spotted a group of\nmonsters approaching. Nothing like a good crisis to come at you out of nowhere, huh? They were small in size, their equipment plain and crude. Their faces\nwere dirty and devoid of intelligence, but with their swords, their shields,\ntheir stone axes, and their bows, they weren’t entirely bestial.

Talk about sticking to the script.\n\nNo doubt they were here to attack the\nweakest of would-be heroes—which meant me, I guess. But, really, thirty of\nthem against a single slime? Kind of a lot at once, wasn’t it? And yet, I didn’t feel so much as a whiff of terror. My instincts told me I\nhad absolutely nothing to fear. Their swords had rust on them, and their\narmor was thin and torn at the edges. Some of them were dressed in nothing\nbut stained rags. Compared to the hard-scaled lizards and the spiders with\nmassive serrated blades on their feet I had dealt with before, I couldn’t\nimagine their gear inflicting any damage at all on me. Besides, if things got\nhairy, I could just go into black-snake mode and Poisonous Breath them all\ninto puddles of goo…\nAs I sized them up, the goblins’ apparent leader opened his mouth. “Grah! Strong one… Have you business here?”\nHuh. Goblins talk. Or maybe Magic Sense is helping me decipher their\ngrunting. And—come on, “strong one”? First they’re surrounding me with their\nweapons; then they’re rolling out the red carpet for me… What do they\nwant? It got me curious. They didn’t look ready to descend upon me\nimmediately. It might be a good chance to test out my speaking abilities. No\nbetter time to start than now. I gave the goblins a quick look-over. To them, this must have been one of the most frantic moments in their\nlives. Their eyes, as well as their weapons, were trained on me, although at\nleast a few of them were ready to flee at the least provocation. The leader,\nmeanwhile, was every bit up to the post, his steely eyes practically drilling\nholes in my gelatinous form. Hmm.\n\nThey seem intelligent enough. Maybe this conversation thing\ncould work out after all. But will they understand me? I focused my thoughts on my still-newborn voice and gingerly tried a\nfew words. “Good to meet you, I guess?

We, we see mighty power of you. Please! Quiet\nthe voice of you!”\nMm? Did I put too much force into it? Maybe making myself\nunderstood wasn’t such a big deal after all. Plainly, I was freaking them out. I figured an apology was in order. “Sorry, I don’t have this fine-tuned\ntoo well yet…”\n“We, we need no apology from such great form of you!”\nGuess that worked. This is turning into some decent practice. I was\nimpressed that plain old Japanese worked on these guys. With all the\npoliteness they gave me, I figured I should return the favor—but given how\nterrified some of them were, I might as well show off the confidence they\nthought I had. “So what did you need from me? I don’t have any business around\nhere.”\n“I see. Village of us is ahead. We felt strong monster nearby, so we came\nto patrol.”\n“A strong monster? I didn’t spot anything like that…?”\n“G-gaah! Grah-gah-gah! Such joking! You cannot trick us, even with\nform of you!”\nThese guys totally have the wrong idea. Apparently they thought their\npowerful intruder had disguised himself as a slime. These were goblins, the\nworld-famous lower caste of the monster totem pole. I shouldn’t have\nexpected much. The goblins and I spoke for a while longer, and before long, I wound up\nreceiving an invitation to their village. They were willing to put me up for a\nbit, even. Pretty nice guys, given how scraggly they all looked. So I\naccepted. I had no need to sleep, but a little rest never hurt a guy. Along the way, I got to hear a bit of the local gossip.

And so on.\n\nAnd funnily enough, the more we spoke to each other, the more clearly I\n\nbegan to understand them. It must have been my Magic Sense skills getting\nmore accustomed to however the goblin language was wending its way\nthrough the particles in the air. Maybe getting in some practice with goblins\nbefore my big human debut was a good idea after all, I thought as I\nfollowed along. The village was shockingly dingy. Maybe I shouldn’t have expected\nmuch from a goblin’s den. They guided me to what I supposed was the most\nstructurally sound of the buildings. It had a thatched, pitted roof that was\nrotting away in areas, the walls bearing nothing but a few pieces of flat\nwood nailed to them.\n\nNo slum I’d ever seen in my world could out-filth this\none. “I am sorry to keep you waiting, honored guest,” one of the goblins said\nas he entered. The leader of the expeditionary force I ran into earlier\naccompanied him. “Oh, no need for that,” I said, flashing my salesman’s smile—or in this\ncase, my slime smile. “Don’t worry about me. I haven’t been waiting for\nthat long.”\nSomething about smiling at your conversational partner always did\nwonders to keep negotiations moving your way. Once you were aware of it,\nit was scary how well it worked. Not that I knew what we were negotiating\nyet. “I apologize we cannot provide you more hospitality,” the goblin said as\nhe brought out something resembling tea for me. “I am the elder of this\nvillage.”\nEven goblins must have this stuff, I thought as I took a sip (well,\ntechnically, slid my way over the teacup, but same difference). I couldn’t\ndetect any taste from it, which made sense, since I didn’t have that sense.\n\nThat might have been for the better, for all I knew. My Analysis skills\ndidn’t detect any poison, but reportedly it bore a bitter, acrid flavor. It was good to see the goblins trying to play nice with me, though, so I\nmade sure to politely drink it up. Then I decided to get to the point. “So to what do I owe the favor?” I\nasked. “What made you decide to invite me over to your village?” This had\nto be more than monsters acting buddy-buddy with each other.

Then, firming up his resolve, he turned\nto me.\n\n“You have heard, I trust, that the monsters have been more active around\nhere as of late?”\nI had, on the way here. “Our god has protected the peace in this land for generations, but about\na month ago, he hid himself from us. That has allowed the nearby monsters\nto start meddling with our lands once more.

Here I am, exuding all this mystical\nstuff, and I didn’t even bother to say “excuse me.” I felt as if I were walking\ndown the middle of Main Street, baring everything I had to the world. With\nall the magicules in the air over in the cave, I’d been completely oblivious. This is bad! Really bad! But at least it explained how the monsters in the\nforest reacted to me before now. Not too many of them would have wanted\nto take on this hombre. No one was stupid enough to be fooled by\nappearances. Well, might as well run with it. “Hee-hee-hee… Impressive, elder. You noticed?”\n“Of course, my friend! Even in the shape that you are, there is certainly\nno hiding the strength inside you!”\n“Ah. Well, if you spotted me, then I guess you guys have a lot of\npromise!”\nNow I’m diggin’ this! Let’s just pull the elder’s strings for a bit and talk\nmy way out of trouble. At the same time, I tried to find a way to extinguish\n\nthe mystical aura around me, futzing around with the surrounding magic to\ntry to push it back in. “Ohh… Were we being tested, perhaps? Then I certainly hope we are\nworthy. Many would be cowed to submission by such a force.”\nBy this time, my mystical whatever was mostly hidden. I was back to\nbeing just a regular old slime. Funny to think, though—earlier, if I had\nlooked like any old slime on the street, would the entire forest have tried to\nkill me? That would’ve been a bummer.\n\n“You’re right.

State your business.”\nHere’s the rundown. It turned out some newcomer monsters from the lands to the east had\nbeen pushing into the area, hoping to seize it for themselves. The area was\nhome to several goblin villages, including this one, and even the small\nclashes so far had resulted in a large number of goblin deaths—including\nsome named goblins. One of these named creatures was the sort-of guardian of this village,\nand with his death, the value of keeping this village intact had declined\ndramatically. The other goblin communities had largely abandoned this land. Their\nreasoning was that they could coerce the newcomers to attack this village,\nbuying them time to come up with countermeasures of their own. The\nvillage elder and the leader of the expedition who greeted me had tried to\nreason with them but were coldly brushed away. The frustration was clear\nin their voices as the two of them explained. “I see,” I replied. “So how many of you live in this village? And how\nmany are battle ready?”\n“We have approximately one hundred residents. Counting our\n\nwomenfolk, about sixty of them are ready to fight.”\nDoesn’t sound like much. Pretty smart goblins, though, if they’re keeping\ntrack that closely.\n\n“All right. And what types and numbers are we talking about with the\nenemy?”\n“They are direwolves, we believe—certainly wolflike in appearance. Under normal circumstances, it would have to be ten of us against one of\nthem for us to have a fighting chance…but they appear to number around a\nhundred themselves.”\nHuh? What kind of impossible game is this? I turned my eyes toward the\nvillage elder. He didn’t seem to be joking; his eyes were as sincere and\ndedicated as a goblin’s could get. “So these goblin fighters took them on in such small numbers, even\nthough they knew they couldn’t win?”\n“…No. This information I told you… Those fighters risked their lives to\nobtain it.”\nOh.", "token_len": 608, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

Upon further questioning, the named goblin they’d lost turned out to be\nboth the elder’s son and the older brother of the scouting party. I spent a\nmoment weighing the options, the elder falling silent as he awaited my\ndecision. It might have been my imagination, but I could have sworn there\nwere tears in his eyes… I was probably just imagining it, though. Tears\ndon’t go too well with monsters. Better pump up the swagger, I figured. That’s how a feared monster\nshould rightly act! “Let’s get something straight, elder. If I help this village, what do I get in\nreturn? Do you even have anything to give?”\nNot that I minded helping them out on a whim. But it took ten goblins to\nmaybe beat one big dog or whatever, and they’d be facing a pack of a\nhundred. It wouldn’t be simple. I think a little black-snake action could take\ncare of them…but I can’t just snap up this job without thinking a bit. “We shall give you our allegiance! Please, grant us your guardianship. If\nyou do, I promise we will swear our loyalty to you!”\nHonestly, as gifts go, that’s not much. But after experiencing ninety days\nof silent solitude, even talking to goblins was kind of fun. The thought of\nsaving this dive probably would’ve disgusted me back in my human days,\nbut right now, I was a monster. No need to worry about falling in a puddle\n\nand picking up some infectious disease any longer. Plus, those eyes on the elder. I could tell that he was truly relying on me\nto say the right thing. I reflected on my past life. When someone asked me to do something, I\nalways did it.

And that’s how I became the guardian of a goblin\nvillage. The direwolves ruled the roost over at the plains to the east, enough to give\nendless headaches to the merchants who plied their trade between the\nEastern Empire and the kingdoms around the Forest of Jura. Each one of\nthem was the equivalent of a C-ranked monster, hardy enough that an\nadventurer could find his leg bitten off if he wasn’t paying attention. The real threat, however, came when they roamed in packs. Only when a\ntalented alpha was leading the horde did the direwolves show their real\nworth. The entire pack would act as a single mind, a single creature, every\nmember acting in lockstep. Such a pack, in full motion, could easily be\nrated a B. The eastern plains were located next to a wide grain-producing region, a\nvital lifeline for the Eastern Empire and one kept very well secured. No\nmatter how cunning the direwolves were, no matter how advanced their\nskills, penetrating the Empire’s defensive lines remained a difficult task. Even if they made it through, doing so would rouse the full fury of the\nEmpire, putting the direwolf race’s very future into question. The pack’s leader was fully aware of this. It was something he had\nlearned through hard-fought experience, amid the many skirmishes he had\nwitnessed against the Empire over several decades. Targeting the smallerscale merchants who passed by wasn’t enough to make the Empire take full\naction—but the moment wolves stepped into its grain fields, it would truly\nretaliate.", "token_len": 506, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

That was the alpha’s way of thinking. But his\nmonster’s instincts also told him that, under the status quo, there would be\nno progress, nothing to push their pack forward. As a rule, the direwolf race did not require food to survive. Attacking\nand consuming humans provided them with a nice little snack, but those\ndidn’t hold much in the way of magic. To the pack, their real sustenance lay in the world’s magicules. They\nwould need to attack stronger monsters or slaughter humans in droves to\nevolve into calamity-level creatures. None of these options were\nparticularly accessible to them. The Empire was just too powerful. But\nmerely picking off passing merchants would never do anything for their\ndreams of evolution. Then they heard tales of the southlands. A fertile territory, one with a\nforest that offered all its blessings—a vast store of magic. A paradise for\nmonsters, so it was said. In order to reach it, though, they would have to\ntraverse the vast Forest of Jura. The monsters of this wood were, in and of themselves, no great foes.\n\nTheir past experience hunting the stragglers wandering out of it proved as\nmuch. So why had they shied away from entering it themselves? Simple: Veldora the Storm Dragon. He was the one and only reason. Even when he was within his prison, the waves of dreadful magical force\nshook their very hearts. The creatures in the forest, they believed, enjoyed\nthe dragon’s divine guardianship—which was why they could survive under\nthose scorching waves. That was what they had to believe.\n\nOtherwise, the\ntruth would drive them mad. So despite how it pained them daily, the direwolves had given up on\ninfiltrating the forest. Until now. The alpha turned his bloodred eyes toward the forest. That evil, horrid\ndragon could no longer be felt.

The idea made him lick his lips and sound the howl commanding his pack\nto advance.\n\nOkay. So now I’m a guardian. What should I do next? To me, it just felt like\nbodyguard duty, despite the grandiose terms the elder used to describe me. To start out, I had all the goblins capable of fighting gathered around\nme. It wasn’t a pretty sight.\n\nThey were in awful shape. No way could I\ncount on them on the battlefield. And from afar, the remainder of the village\nlooked like…nothing but children and the elderly to me. Reinforcements, in\nother words, were out of the question. The village elder must have been shaking at the knees. Even if they fled\nthe village right now, they’d practically starve before the day was through. Meanwhile, the goblins around me were all staring with an almost\nreligious faith in their eyes. This was heavy, man. To someone like me, who\nlived a fairly easy-breezy life, those gazes added a lot of pressure. “Right,” I said, “do all of you know what kind of situation we’re in?”\nI wasn’t trying to make a joke. I just couldn’t think of anything\ninspirational I could say. “Yes, sir!” the goblin leader instantly replied. “We are preparing for a\nbattle to decide whether we live or die!”\nThe other goblins around him must have felt the same way. Some of\nthem were visibly shaking, which I couldn’t chide them for. A person’s\nmind can think one thing and their body do something very different. “All right,” I replied, trying to act like the best general I could. “No need\nto get all worked up. Keep it chill, all right? Whether you’re revved up or\nnot, if we’re gonna lose, we’re gonna lose. Just focus on giving this\neverything you’ve got!”\nThat helped lighten my mood, at least. Maybe it worked better than I\nthought.\n\nMight as well get started, then. If I screw up, that might be it for these\ngoblins. But I gotta stick to my guns.

The direwolves’ alpha had his eyes open. It was a full moon—the\nperfect night for a battle. Slowly, he rose, surveying the area, the rest of his\n\npack looking on with bated breath. Just the right amount of intensity, the alpha thought. Tonight, they would level the goblin village, establishing a foothold for\nthemselves within the Forest of Jura. Then, slowly but surely, they would\nhunt the monsters around the area, expanding their territory until they ruled\nthe woods. Soon, when the time was right, they would turn their eyes\ntoward the south, invading it for the power it held. They had the strength to make it happen. Their claws could rend the\nflesh of any monster; their fangs could pierce any armor. “Awooooooooooo!”\nThe alpha gave the signal. It was time to let the carnage begin. There was, however, one concern. The alpha had sent a scout a few days ago who had come back with\nsome perplexing news—news of a small monster that let off a strange,\nmystical force. Enough to surpass that of even their alpha.\n\nHe had shrugged off this report at first. It was too preposterous to\nentertain. He himself had detected nothing of the sort in the forest. Every\nmonster they’d encountered was a comparative weakling. Up to this point,\nnothing even resembling resistance to their advance had appeared—and\nthey were almost in the dead center of the wood. A dozen or so goblins had\npicked off one or two members of their pack, but nothing else. The scout must have been too excited about the upcoming hunt to think\nstraight. That was the alpha’s conclusion as he kept his eyes forward. Ahead lay a village. It was situated exactly where the scout said it was. He had followed the trail of a wounded goblin straight to it. Nothing about\nhis report suggested it to be a threat. This was not the alpha’s first battle.\n\nHe was cunning, and he never let\nhis guard down. However, even he had to admit that the strange…thing\naround the village was a tad unusual. It was…a fence, like one would see in a human village. The homes that\nonce composed the settlement had been disassembled, formed into a\ndefense that neatly covered all of the village grounds.

Move away from here\nat once!”\nImpertinent little bastard. Leaving just one entryway open to block a\nmass attack? Just the kind of shallow thinking one should expect from a\ngarbage monster like this. Our claws and fangs would make mincemeat out\nof that rickety old thing. It was time to show this slime their true power. The alpha gave the order. As if they were his own right hand, about a dozen direwolves immediately\nset off to attack the fence—the picture of coordination, the exact reason the\npack essentially functioned as a single monster. The Thought Communication skill enabled their collective behavior. It\nwas far faster than giving verbal orders, letting the pack work in perfect\ntandem. The first wave should have been all it took to destroy the fence. Instead\nthe alpha, already picturing a screaming rabble of goblins struggling to flee\nafter the miserable failure of their stratagem, let out a surprised yelp. The\nforce he had sent toward the fence had been blown straight backward, some\nof them bleeding profusely as they writhed on the ground. What could this be?\n\nThe alpha kept his mind sharp as he surveyed the\narea. The slime by the entryway had not moved an inch. Did it do\nsomething? One of his men sidled up to him to report. It was him, boss! The thing\nwith the mystical force that outclassed yours! Nonsense, the alpha thought as he looked at the slime. It was a small\nmonster. They would occasionally be born here and there along the plains. Even calling them “monsters” at all seemed absurd—their whole existence\nwas petty. That thing, holding more force than me…? The alpha fumed.\n\nImpossible! Few, indeed, were the monsters more sly and crafty than the alpha. He\nhad years of experience to draw upon, and he could summon it on the fly to\ncalmly, nimbly formulate a new plan. And his years of experience told him\nthat this monster could not possibly be stronger than he was. Right there, for the first time, the alpha committed a fatal mistake—one\nthat would ultimately decide his fate.\n\nYou wretched little worm of a monster—I shall crush you to pieces!", "token_len": 675, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

I was hoping we could talk things\nover a little first, but they forced me to throw out my entire script. And after\nall that rehearsing I did while the fence was being built. The first order I’d given the goblins was to show me where the wounded\nwere. Adding a dozen or so survivors to the sixty fighters we had wouldn’t\nmake the work go much more efficiently, but given their devotion for me, I\nwanted to do what I could for them.

The healing process took a little time, but it worked.\n\nOnce I was done\n\nwith everyone, I gave the remaining goblins a new order—the fence. A simple wooden affair would have been fine, I thought, but we didn’t\nhave much time or material to work with. We had to go with what we had,\nso that was what I did—without a moment’s pause, I had them tear down\ntheir homes and use the wood and other components to fortify the whole\ncommunity. In the meantime, I ordered the goblins who were decent with a bow to\ngo on scout duty. I warned them not to wander too far afield—wolves were\nbound to have good noses. I could tell by their eyes that they were willing\nto sacrifice themselves for the cause. They were ready to shout out “By my\nvery life!” at any moment. A lot more bravado than I really needed right\nnow, but I doubted there was any quick fix for it. As night fell, around a day after I arrived at the village, the final planks\nwere on the fence. The finishing touches were mine—spider silk to\nstrengthen and solidify the paling and a few Steel Thread traps here and\nthere. Anyone touching the fence without knowing the secret would be\ncarved up before they knew what hit them. I’ll have to remember to go fetch\na body or two later. I made sure the fence had a single entryway on one side. Once it was\nlined with Sticky Thread, my job here was done. All that remained was to\nwait for the scouts to come back.

I’d assumed I’d need to\napply several doses to the graver-looking of the patients, but it worked a\nhell of a lot better than I’d thought. I had no complaints about that mistake. After that, I had the goblins collect the extra material, pile it up in the\ncenter of the village grounds, and set it on fire. It reminded me of more than\none camping trip, but now was no time for marshmallows. We would need\nto keep watch the whole night through. I offered to handle it alone but was\nsharply refused. “Nothing doing, Sir Rimuru! We could never allow you to shoulder such\na heavy burden!”\n“She is right! We will handle watch duty for you. Please, Sir Rimuru,\ntake the time to rest a little!”\nThe rabble around us echoed their approval.

Funny how I thought they\nwere these ugly, filth-ridden monsters two days ago.\n\nNow I was starting to\nfeel actual affection for them. If I had my way, I thought as I applied the\nfinal Sticky Thread to the entryway, I’d like to get them through this without\nlosing a single one. So that was our prep process, more or less. Hostilities were under way,\nso there wasn’t much else I could do. At this point, we had to stick to the\nplan. I wasn’t convinced the fence was strong enough to hold, but fortunately,\nthe direwolves couldn’t grab hold of it long enough to do much. The traps\nmostly sprang just as I’d planned. That was a relief. Anticipating this, I had ordered small slits built into the fence at regular\nintervals. Those openings were for arrows so the goblins could attack from\nthe inside and interfere with the enemy’s movements. They opened fire, and\neven with their crappy aim, they made more than a few direwolves scream\ntheir last. A few of the enemy force tried to pry the spaces open and break\nin that way…only to have their heads caved in by the stone-ax-wielding\ngoblins on either side of each hole. Two hours wasn’t nearly enough practice time, but this village was\nplaying for keeps. They listened to everything I said, understood it, and\ntook action.\n\nAnd we were reaping the rewards. The wolves were strong,\nyes, capable of taking on a gaggle of goblins at once, and maybe they were\neven stronger as a pack. But if they were powerful solo, we could just strike\n’em all together. If they were powerful as a team, we’d make sure they\ncouldn’t team up. Use your head, and you can make it work. The strongest\ncreature in the world, after all, is a human being with a little intelligence! Your luck just ran out, I thought to myself as I stared into the cold eyes\nof the direwolf boss.

The confused direwolf alpha was shocked at how far awry his plans had\n\ngone. His pack was beginning to fall into disarray. That couldn’t be allowed to\ncontinue. The direwolf tribe shone its brightest only when grouped together. Mistrust in the alpha would lead to fatal results. He understood that, too—\nand that was why he then made his greatest mistake of all. He was enraged\nat the weakness of his pack, unable to overcome a simple fence, but he was\neven more afraid that his team’s frustration would soon be directed at him. I need to display my strength to them, he thought. I am the strongest of\nmy pack. I am more than strong enough, even by myself! That was the moment when everything was decided. My eyes were still firmly upon the direwolf boss. To the goblins, he had\ndisappeared, I assumed, but to me, he was ambling along at a yawn-worthy\npace. Everything was going to plan. I had considered a few possible outcomes,\nand now one of them was playing out in front of me. These were animals,\nafter all.\n\nNot ex-humans like me. The Sticky Thread over the entryway immediately captured the boss. For all I knew, the silk wouldn’t be enough to keep a direwolf leader stuck\ntight. There’d been no way to test it beforehand, but that didn’t matter\nanymore. The Sticky Thread was there just so we could keep the boss in\nplace for a single moment. If I didn’t hold him in place and he dodged the ensuing Water Blade\nattack, that would look super lame. Or worse, I could catch my team in\nfriendly fire.\n\nIn the midst of a battle, that was entirely possible. That was why I devised the trap. But maybe I over-engineered it a little. These guys hadn’t even gotten the fence down yet. I’d considered lining the\nentrance with Steel Thread instead but opted against it, worried that it\nwouldn’t be enough of a final blow. In situations like these, it was my job to play the ultimate strongman, the\nruler of the roost. That was what all this was for—and that’s why, without\nanother moment of self-doubt, I launched a Water Blade at the boss’s head. It hit home. The head launched upward, and then gravity took it.

Submit to me or die!”\nSo how will they deal with that? Will their boss’s death drive them into\nsuch a frenzy that they’ll bum-rush me? I’d like to avoid that, if I could. The remaining direwolves showed no sign of moving. Uh-oh.\n\nThis isn’t\ngonna be one of those “I’d sooner die than submit to the likes of you!”\nthings, is it? ’Cause if it is, it’s gonna be all-out war. We were still losing\nnumbers-wise, and we’d definitely take some casualties. We made it this far\nwithout any goblin blood—I doubted we’d lose at this point, but I’d prefer\nit ended without a struggle. It was oddly quiet, compared to the pitched battle of a moment ago. I\ncould feel the gazes of the direwolves upon me. Amid their stares, I\ngradually started glooping forward. I couldn’t tell how they’d interpret this,\nbut I wanted to hammer it home that their boss was dead. In a moment, I was at the alpha’s limp body. Nobody offered any\nobjection. One of their pack, which had taken up position nearby, retreated\na step. Then I swallowed the corpse. As was my right as victor, yeah? The Sage’s voice rang in my mind. Analysis complete. Mimic: Direwolf ability obtained. Direwolf intrinsic\nskills “Keen Smell,” “Thought Communication,” and “Coercion”\nacquired. Sounds like a win to me. But despite seeing their own boss eaten in front\nof them, the rest of the direwolves still showed no sign of movement. Hmmm… At this point, they were either gonna freak out and run, or freak\nout and come for me.\n\n…Oh, right! I told them “submit or die,” didn’t I? Ah, shit. That\nmight’ve been throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Better give ’em an\nescape route, I thought as I transformed myself into one of them.

Now they were kowtowing to me, although it looked more as if they\nwere having a lie-down for a nap. But regardless, they had apparently\nchosen “submit” anyway. Maybe they’d been having a little Thought\nCommunication conference about it while they were standing there like\nstatues. It beats having to fight them, anyway. That, more or less, marked the official end of the battle at this goblin\nvillage. That’s always the thing, though, isn’t it? It’s not the fight that’s the hard\npart; it’s all the goddamn cleanup afterward. Who’s the idiot that ordered them to destroy their own homes? What’re\nwe gonna do about those? And where’re all these goblins gonna sleep\ntonight? And what am I supposed to do with all these dogs? I mean, sure,\nwe killed off a fair number of them, but that’s still, like, eighty more mouths\nto feed. I, um… Ah, screw it.\n\nThat’s all for today, people! I’ll think about it\ntomorrow, once everyone wakes up. For the time being, I ordered the goblins to camp out next to the fire,\ntold the dogs to go on standby around the village, and called it a night. Morning came. I had spent the previous night thinking, mostly. The conclusion I came\nup with: Let the goblins take care of the direwolves! Perfect! We had a total of seventy-two goblins left in fighting shape. No\ncasualties from yesterday. At most, a few scratches. Meanwhile, we had\neighty-one surviving direwolves parked outside the town fence—some\nwounded, but none so badly that a little recovery potion didn’t prop them\nright back up.

He wanted to help me out somehow, I\nguess, but there wasn’t much an old goblin geezer could do for me. My\npersonal aesthetic tastes remained unchanged from my human years. That would never change, even though I was transmogrified into a\nslime. There would be no charming village princess I could ride off into the\nsunset with. I’d probably have to wait a while for that. In front of this line of goblins, I summoned the direwolves. “Um, okay,”\nI began, “from now on, I’m gonna have you all form pairs and live with\neach other, all right?”\nThen I gauged the response. I didn’t get much of one. They were waiting\nfor me to continue, I guessed, not making a single sound as they stared at\nme. Nobody seemed to openly grimace at the idea of pairing up, at least, so\nI assumed I was on decent enough ground. “Uh, do you understand what I mean? Like, groups of two, okay? Get to\nit!”\nThe moment I finished speaking, the goblins and the direwolves began\nexchanging glances with whoever was in front of them. Slowly and meekly,\nthey followed my order. Yesterday’s enemy is today’s friend, and all that. They had to learn that the hard way, but at least everyone was on board.\n\nThen I noticed something.

Hang on, do any of these guys have names at\nall? How are they supposed to call for each other and stuff?\n\nWhat a pain in\nthe ass. “Elder,” I said as I watched the pairing process unfold to my side, “it’s\ntoo inconvenient for me to refer to you and your people. I’d like to give\nnames to you all. Would that be all right?”\nEveryone must have heard me somehow. Right at the word names, every\nsingle one of them was locked on to me—even the nonfighting goblins,\nclearly thrown by this turn of events. “Are…are you sure…?” the elder timidly asked. What’s the big deal, huh? “Y-yeah, um… If it’s not a problem, I’d like to give out some names?”\nIt was as if I’d simultaneously blown the minds of every goblin on the\npremises. Each one erupted into enthusiastic cheering. What the hell? It’s as\nif they all just hit the lottery or something. If getting a name makes you that\nhappy, why don’t you just do it yourselves? It all seemed so simple to me\nback then.\n\nI started with the elder, asking him what his son’s name was. He had\nbeen the sole named goblin in the village, now sadly passed. It was “Rigur,”\napparently. So I added a d on the end and named the elder “Rigurd.” No particular\nreason for it—it just sounded nice. “If your son was here,” I joked, “you\ncould have him state his name and just kinda add d to the end of it, y’see?”\nNo one laughed. They thought I was serious. “I… I cannot express my\ngratitude enough,” he blubbered, “for being granted permission to take on\nmy son’s name!” Yeah, great.

I could’ve added a\n“II” to the end of it, I suppose, but why make this more complicated than it\nhad to be? “Rigur” was fine. Fine enough that it made him kneel before me\nin prayer, as if this was the most emotional moment in his life. Cripes. The\napple doesn’t fall far from the tree. So on I went, down the whole line. I also did the rest of the onlookers\nwhile I was at it, having families figure out their names together and\ncoming up with whatever for the orphans and singles in the village. They aren’t expecting to, like, keep recycling these names for\ngenerations to come, are they? If Rigurd has a grandson, maybe he could\nstart calling himself “Rigurdd.” Or if he has a great-grandson, he could be\n“Rigurddd” and “Rigurd” then gets passed on to the youngest generation. Something like that? Pretty random, maybe, but how else do family\ntraditions ever get started? “Sir Rimuru,” the newly christened Rigurd plaintively asked, “we are so,\nso appreciative of this, but…are… Are you sure?”\n“About what?”\n“I mean, I am fully aware of the extent of your magical powers, Sir\nRimuru, but…providing all of these names in one go… Will you be all\nright?”\nWhat’s he talking about? I’m just handing out names to folks.\n\n“Mm?” I replied. “No, no problem, I don’t think.” Then I went back to\nit. Rigurd raised his eyebrows for a moment, but I paid him no further mind. Once I was done with the goblins, it was time to move on to the\ndirewolves.

Cheap, maybe, but I rolled with it. I’m\nthe Tempest; he’s got fangs…\nWhatever came to mind first was best, I figured. This wasn’t my forte. The moment I named him Ranga, I began to feel as if practically all the\nmagicules flowing through my body were draining out of it. The sense of\nhollowness—of the violent emptying of my innards—was mind blowing. What… What’s going on? It was a fatigue like none I’d felt before. Reporting. Your body’s remaining store of magic has gone below its\nacceptable threshold. Entering sleep mode. Expected to fully recover in\nthree days. I was still conscious. I didn’t need to sleep…exactly, and I could hear\nthe Sage’s voice. Slowly but surely, it began to dawn on me. I’d used too much of my…\nmagic? Like hitting zero MP, sort of? What’d I do to manage that? Had I\nbeen wearing myself out this whole time without realizing it? It sure didn’t\nfeel that way. I tried moving. No response. “Sleep mode” must be something like\nhibernation. I wasn’t asleep, but I couldn’t move at all. All I could do was\nsit around—which was fine, because the goblins had prepared a seat of\nhonor for me by the fire, so I might as well bask in it. Nothing else to do, or\nthat I could do.\n\nI took the opportunity to reflect on what just happened. Why did I run\nout of magic after I started naming people? Did doing that consume\nmagicules somehow? Come to think of it, it really started to flow out once I\nnamed the direwolves’ leader, didn’t it? It was still just a theory, but it seemed clear to me that naming monsters\nactually required magic. That conclusion took around two days to reach. It sure explained why Rigurd was so aghast at what I was doing, among\nother things.

Not that it’d stop me once I could\nmove again, I imagined. Initially, the goblins seemed kind of worried about how I fell stone\nsilent, but…somewhere along the line, the question of who had the right to\nwipe my surface and take care of me almost erupted into violent conflict. What are they doing? This is one harem I seriously wish I weren’t involved\nin. I was starting to feel like a magic lamp people could rub for three\nwishes. Finally, the third day passed. R E C O V E R E D ! Despite depleting my magic earlier, I felt stronger and more magic-rich\nthan I had before my little accident. Magic was the power to exert force\nupon the world, and the particles around me were the energy driving it. That\nseemed to be about the extent of it. Is it one of those “that which does not kill me makes me stronger” types\nof things? I pondered experimenting with it further but decided against it. There didn’t seem to be much need, and if I died in the process, I’d look\nlike an idiot. Yet another case of me going overboard too soon.\n\nAnyway. The worker goblins, realizing I was awake, began congregating around\nme. They were joined by the direwolves, who were streaming in from their\noutside base. Which was fine, but…\n“Um… Hey, guys? Have you all, like, gotten bigger?”\nThey had. Goblins averaged a little under five feet tall. Now they were\nall nearly a full foot taller. The guy next to me looked as if he was pushing\nsix and a half, even. These…are goblins, right? And check out the wolves. I remembered\nthem being a lot browner. Now their fur was straight-on black, with a\nlustrous sheen. They had grown, too, with the bigger ones now pushing nine\nor ten feet in length. I didn’t remember any of them being much longer than\nsix feet before. The one that really caught my eye was the wolf at their forefront,\nwalking silently forward.

This was nothing like the\nboss I beat a few days back—between his looks and his sheer force of\npresence, he had to be some higher-level monster. The star-shaped\nbirthmark on his forehead and the magnificent-looking horn also raised a\nfew red flags. Kiiiinda scary. “My master!” this beast of my worst nightmares bellowed in a fluent\nhuman tongue. “How it elates me to see you well once more!”\nHoly… Is this Ranga? What happened over the past three days? I was\nleft to wonder that for myself as the cheering, howling monsters surrounded\nme. All right…\nSo in the three days I was checked out, all the monsters around me grew. That was freaky.\n\nThe only thing that could produce something like that\nwas…evolution, I suppose. So does naming a monster evolve them? And didn’t Veldora go on about something like that for a while…? The\ndifference between “nameless” and “named” monsters? Oh, right! Something about how earning a name provides a sort of\n“divine blessing” that helps boost your ability as a monster. Hence the\nevolution. Well, hell, no wonder everyone was so happy. And no wonder it tapped\nall my magic reserves at once. Monster evolution happens fast. I’d say they didn’t “grow” so much as\nbecome completely different creatures. The tepid, void-like eyes of the\ngoblins now shone brightly with the pale light of intelligence. And the\nfemales… Yow! They actually kind of look like women now! I was so shocked, I could barely even speak. Huh? …Huh?!\n\nIt made me literally do a double take. These guys were like little imps a\nmoment ago, maybe closer to baboons than humans, and now—well, to use\ntheir official terminology—the males were “hobgoblins” and the females\n“goblinas,” although the latter sounded pretty stupid to me.

A very rare occurrence, and one that excited Rigurd to no end,\njudging by how he couldn’t shut up about it.\n\nThis wasn’t entirely a happy thing for me, though. The female goblins\nhad covered their entire bodies in rags before. Now, thanks to their\nevolution, the skimpy clothing allowed one to see certain…things. There\nwould be no brushing them off now. The males certainly seemed happy\nabout it. Even though they were wearing nothing but loincloths\nthemselves…\nThe village was in desperate need of food, clothing, and shelter. Better\nstart with clothing first, I figured. Another issue I had to deal with was Ranga. He was so delighted that I\nwas back to full consciousness that he wouldn’t stop following me around\nand bothering me. If you like those fuzzballs, I assume you’d be in\nparadise, but I was always more of a cat person. It wasn’t the worst thing,\nbut still. “So, Ranga,” I said, “I’m pretty sure I only named you out of the pack,\nso…how come all the other direwolves evolved, too?”\nIt was true. My magic stores conked out the moment I named this thing. “My master! We, the direwolves, are both one and all. My brethren and I\nare connected together—my name is the name of our tribe!”\nHuh. So the whole gang evolved together. The “one and all” thing was something the previous boss never quite\nfully believed in, as Ranga explained. If he had, that battle might’ve gone in\na different direction. Ranga, meanwhile, had already gained full control\nover his pack, it seemed, allowing them all to evolve from direwolf to\n“tempest wolf.” “More power for everyone” is the way he put it. “Nice work!” I said, since he seemed to be desperately fishing for\npraise.\n\nHe whipped his tail back and forth, a display that was adorable on\nsuch an enormous beast. On the other hand, a happy five-yard wolf could\nproduce nearly enough wind to launch me right out of the village. “Hey, watch what you’re doing with that thing!” I warned him.

How useful, I thought as I\n\ninstructed him to stick to the small side from now on. The biggest issue of all, however, was where the heck we were gonna\nkeep all these guys. The wolf-hobgob pairs seemed to be sharing\nhouseholds with each other by now—not that they had houses, so it was\nreally more the hobs using the wolves as blankets. The lack of clothing was\nkilling me, but housing also needed some attention.\n\nSo.\n\nWhat now? I saw a mountain of food piled up before me. That solved one of our\nproblems, at least. Once I used up all my magic, the rest of them began the evolutionary\nprocess. It took about a day to complete, and they wanted to celebrate with\nboth that and the end of battle with a feast. The elder refused to allow it\nuntil I recovered, however, so instead they spent their time gathering the\nfood first. I had noticed them sparring with one another over who got to shine me\nup during my departure but not the evolution or food-gathering efforts. This\n“sleep mode” made me well-nigh defenseless, it looked like. I’d need to be\ncareful with it. The way they began taking action without waiting for orders, at least,\nwas much appreciated. The evolution process must’ve done wonders for\ntheir intelligence. It might’ve impacted their mental strength even more\nthan the physical. And the food! Back in their regular goblin days, they’d eked out a living\noff fruits, nuts, edible plants, and whatever monsters and animals they could\nhunt down. Now, with the aid of their tempest wolves, they could cover a\nlot more terrain. The pairs had, much to my surprise, gained the ability to use Thought\nCommunication with each other—goblins who could guide their wolves\nmore surely than the best of jockeys.

This entire mountain of food was the results\nfrom the past two days alone.\n\nBut relying on hunting and gathering would leave them in danger if\nsomething happened to their environment. They’d have to start thinking\nabout agriculture pretty soon. A steady food supply is the key to a life of\nplenty. I’d need to figure out what kind of produce grew well here, as well\nas what sort of grain crops (assuming there were different types at all on\nthis planet). Always something new to explore, at least. Today, though, I just wanted to shut off my brain and enjoy the feast. And I did. Well into the night, we celebrated our evolution, the end of war, and—\nmost important to me—my recovery. The next day, I gathered the entire population around me. We had a heap\nof issues to tackle, but I had something even more important to tell them. We needed to hammer out the rules of this village. Rules, as everyone knew in Japan, were a must to maintain a communal\nsociety. “Because I said so!” was only gonna go so far around here, no\nmatter how many times I used that phrase in my old life. At the core, I had three rules in mind—three guiding principles I wanted\nto be sure to have them follow. Everything else, I imagined they could\nfigure out. “Everyone here? All right! I have some rules to give to you! Three, to be\nexact. The bare minimum I want all of you to follow.”\nAnd so I laid out my standards:\n1. Do not attack human beings.\n\n2. Do not fight among your friends. 3. Do not look down upon other species. I could’ve gone with more if I kept thinking about it, but I couldn’t\nexpect them to follow too many from the start. Instead, I just stuck to the\nbasics. But how would they take it?\n\n“Could I ask a question?” Rigur shouted. “Why are we not allowed to\nattack humans?”\nRigurd gave his son the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen from a hobgoblin. Was he afraid I was offended? I wish we could keep things a little more\ninformal, but…\n“Simple: Because I like humans! That is all.”\n“Ah! Very good! I understand!”\nYou…do?

Well, geez, that was easy. But I couldn’t read a single hint of\n\ndissent on any of their faces. I was expecting a little more debate on the\nissue. Talk about a letdown. “Human beings live in groups,” I continued, giving my full explanation\nwhether they needed it or not. “If you lay hands on them, they may retaliate\nin force—and if they throw everything they have at you, I doubt you would\nbe able to defend yourselves. That’s why I prohibit interfering with them. It’d help you all if you were friendly with them, besides…”\nReally, though, it just came down to me liking humans, seeing as I used\nto be one. Ranga nodded deeply at this.\n\nIt seemed to make sense to him. He must\nhave had his own reasons to think challenging mankind was a bad idea. The\nhobgobs, meanwhile, appeared even more convinced than before, so I\ndidn’t bother thinking about them much. “Is there anything else?”\n“What do you mean by ‘Do not look down upon other species’?”\n“Well, all you guys are freshly evolved, right? I’m just saying, don’t let\nthat get to your head and start lording it over all the weaker species! Just\nbecause you’re all a little sturdier doesn’t mean you’re some high-andmighty race now. Sooner or later, your rivals will get just as strong—or\neven stronger—and they’ll want to get back at you. That’d suck, wouldn’t\nit?”\nI had the ears of everyone in the audience. Looks like that worked well\nenough. I was sure some of them wouldn’t listen to reason, but it’s best to\ntry to nip these things in the bud, anyway. “That’s pretty much it. Stick to those rules as much as you can, all\nright?”\nThe first rules the village ever had were set in stone. Everyone nodded\ntheir approval, and with that, the curtain rose on a new life for them all.\n\nWith local laws out of the way, it was time to start divvying up roles.

Now he’s a hobgoblin in the prime of his\nlife—fit, muscular, and bursting with energy. He might even be stronger\nthan Rigur. How did that happen? The more I mess with this magic stuff, the\ncrazier it all seems to me. “Very well,” I crowed. “It is in your hands now, Rigurd! Now, I was\nwatching the construction work. It’s terrible, isn’t it?”\nOne could barely call the structures houses. These were stronger,\nsmarter goblins now, but I suppose asking them to suddenly develop\ntechnical skills was asking a bit much. “It pains me to admit so, Sir Rimuru. We never had a need for very large\nbuildings in the past…”\n“Yeah. You guys are bigger now, after all. As for clothing… You guys\nare all exposing way too much flesh. Could you maybe pass some clothes\naround?”\n“Ah! Yes! There are some people I know that we’ve had dealings with\nseveral times. Perhaps they could supply clothing that could fit our needs. In fact, with their skills, they might know how to build homes as well!”\nHmm. Having worked for a contractor, I had an eye for decent building quality. In terms of what I could actually construct, however, my skill was limited\nto your basic Sunday afternoon DIY projects. Not enough to serve as a\nbuilding foreman. If these businessmen could help with that, perhaps it’d be\n\nworth paying them a visit. “I see,” I replied. “It wouldn’t hurt to talk to them. What did you pay\nthem with, though? Money?”\n“No, Sir Rimuru. We do have some currency that we confiscated from\nadventurers, but that remains in storage. Instead, we have obtained the\nmaterials we need via either barter or short-term work.”\n“Oh. So who are these guys?”\n“They are known as dwarves.”\nDwarves!

Their armor provided no more\nprotection than tatters—and they couldn’t even use it, because it didn’t fit\nanymore. It was certainly an issue, and tackling it right now would be\nkilling two birds with one stone. Just one problem. Almost nothing they had seized from passing\nadventurers was of much use any longer, and whatever money they had\nstored up couldn’t be very much. What could we trade? Another problem to\nshelve for later, perhaps…\n“I’ll try visiting them. Can you make the arrangements for me, Rigurd?”\n“Ah! Ah, of course, Sir Rimuru! I’ll have everything for your journey by\ntomorrow afternoon!”\nHe sounded enthusiastic enough about it that I felt safe in his hands. He’d probably give me whatever money was left, too, not that I should\nexpect much. Currency, though, huh? It’d be funny if it was paper. Thinking about it, though, I didn’t have much money to my name, either. The fact that currency existed at all in this world was a nice surprise, at\nleast. I’d figured it did, but I’d had no idea how it was circulated at all. Once I reach a human town, I’ll have to go around and check out prices.\n\nBut that can wait until after the dwarves. After all the hard work getting this\ntown in shape, a leisurely visit would do wonders for me. I’ll be with my\nown humankind soon enough—checking out one of the other races could\nhelp me learn a little more about this wacky world. Although technically a subrace of people, the dwarves apparently lived\nin large towns of their own. They had a king as well, although no goblin\nwas ever permitted even a glance.

It was hard to explain—as if I had\njust completed something I was meant to do. It felt as though my mind\nbelonged to someone else. The terror was unbearable. But… In another moment, it all fixed itself. Ifrit’s consciousness filled\nmy soul anew, bottling up my anxieties and my fear. It did, in the end, keep me from going mad inside. It helped shelter me\nfrom the guilt I should have felt at killing. Not that I was incapable of that\nemotion—Ifrit just exercised his complete control over me to ensure I never\nfelt it.

I didn’t want to lose out to any of my fellow students, and I\nhated being treated like someone special.\n\nThat was what drove me to\nimprove. One day, I befriended a young girl named Pirino, a gentle, quiet girl just\na tad older than I was. We were in the forest, on a hunt as part of our\npractical battle training, and we struck up a conversation. Pirino would\nalways go off on her own, which struck me as odd, so I decided to follow\nher. “Fwee!”\nThere, I spotted her playing with a baby wind fox. She had been giving\nit food, taking care of it on the sly. It was a monster, a magical beast, but\nalso cute and still too small to go hunting by itself. It was alone, separated\nfrom its parents, but it was alive and thriving. “Ah…!” Pirino hid the wind fox behind her as she whirled around,\nshocked by my presence. “I—I was caring for this,” she stammered,\nrealizing I had seen it. “It’d just be mean to leave it to die… Don’t tell\nanyone, okay?!”\nHer eyes wavered with anxiety. I could tell her aims were noble. This\nwas a small life in her hands; she wanted to protect it. Maybe I was jealous\nof that wind fox. It wasn’t alone anymore, I felt, but I was.\n\n“All right,” I bashfully said, “but…can I take care of it with you?”\nPirino stared blankly for a moment, then flashed a serene smile. “Of\ncourse! In fact, I hope you can. My name is Pirino!”\nI gave her my name, and we exchanged a few pleasantries. She was the\nfirst friend I ever had in my life. “What did you name it?” I asked her. Pirino gave me another look. “Name it?", "token_len": 680, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

Pirino gave me another look. “Name it?\n\nMonsters don’t have names. They can communicate with each other through their minds.”\n“But I’d feel bad if this guy didn’t have a name, though. Hey, is it okay\nif I come up with one?”\n“Really?\n\nBut they said we aren’t allowed to name monsters…”\n“Please? Come on, just once?”\nI didn’t quite understand what Pirino meant. No matter what it took, I\nbelieved the wind fox deserved a name. After a few more moments, she\ngrudgingly nodded at me—and in another moment, we were both having\nfun coming up with names. Ultimately, we settled on “Pizu,” a mixture of Pirino and Shizu. It\nseemed to symbolize our newfound friendship, in a way. I was happy with\nit. “Fweee!!”\nIt would always cry with glee like that whenever Pirino or I used its\nname. It must have liked what we chose, and I enjoyed the reaction. Pirino\nwould smile, too. This is so much fun! I had been so alone, but Pirino and Pizu were there to soothe my heart. We came to visit Pizu on regular occasions. A few days after we named it, the wind fox grew from something we\ncould keep on our palms to a creature about the size of our heads. It\nsurprised us, but considering how attached it was to us, we didn’t mind. If\nanything, we were glad it was large enough to hunt for itself. Sometimes,\nit’d even have a bird or wild hare for us when we visited. “Do you think we could take it to the castle, Shizu? It’s really smart, and\nmaybe it could help out around the place…”\n“Huh?”\nFrankly, I wanted it to remain our little secret. But faced with Pirino’s\npleading eyes, I couldn’t bear to say it.

A\nwind fox this intelligent and this friendly to people—Pirino insisted—could\neasily be recognized as a servant beast. That was the start of the tragedy. “Fweeeeee!!”\nI suppose you could say it was just bad luck that we passed by the\ndemon lord Leon in a castle hallway. But it wasn’t. It was our fault for\nassuming we had the strength to watch over anything in life. “Run… Run, Pizu…!!”\nComing across Leon spooked Pizu beyond all consoling. It leaped right\nout of Pirino’s clasped hands, hackles raised at Leon in a show of\nintimidation. The act made my titan awaken. The moment it did, I lost all autonomy. Pirino was so close, but she sounded so far away. Ifrit didn’t care how I felt\nand lashed out at the snarling Pizu. There was no stopping my body, no\nmatter how hard I struggled, as it grabbed Pizu and incinerated it. With my\nvery own hand. That wasn’t the end of it. The flames from my hand formed a white,\nswirling vortex, attacking the girl that had brought Pizu to Leon. Without so\nmuch as a sound, it rendered her into a pile of ash that disappeared in\nmoments. As if there were never anyone there at all.

We’d just figure out what to do once we\nshowed up. For a goblin on foot, it would apparently take around two months to walk to\nthe Dwarven Kingdom. We would be largely following the Great Ameld\nRiver, which flowed through the forest, up to its source in a mountain range\nthat held the settlement we sought. These were the Canaat Mountains, which neatly separated the Empire to\nthe east and the small litter of nations here and there around the Forest of\nJura. There were, by and large, three trade routes that ran between the two\npockets of civilization. One put you right through the forest; another was a\nmore treacherous route through the mountains; the third was by sea. The\nJura route would normally be the shortest and safest, but for some reason, it\nwas only rarely taken advantage of—most travelers challenged the\nmountains instead, what with the travel costs and potential sea-monster\ninterference a ship route presented. In addition to these three routes, there were a handful of other ways to\nreach the Dwarven Kingdom, but they all charged tolls. This was\nmandatory, supposedly to keep people from transporting dangerous goods\nalong the paths. It was a decent enough option for small bands, but the\nlarger caravans avoided them for the costs and time involved. They were\nsafe, no doubt, and we’d have to consider one of them later, depending on\nhow our finances held out. We had no business with the Empire, so there was no point traveling east\nto leave the woods. It was straight north to the Canaats. We wouldn’t have\nto go up to any peaks, at least—the kingdom was situated at the base of the\nmountains, in the upper reaches of the Great Ameld. A beautiful hub of\ncivilization, by the sound of it, built into a gigantic natural cavern. That was the Dwarven Kingdom. So we followed the plan, tracing the Great Ameld River’s route\nnorthward. It certainly kept us from getting lost.\n\nI had a map in my brain\n\nanyway, just in case.

At this pace, we might not even need a week for the whole trip. Not that\nI was in a hurry. I wanted to work out the housing and clothing situation\nback at the village, but that wasn’t a problem we could solve in a night and\na day regardless. “Hey!” I shouted. “Don’t wear yourself out, now!”\nRanga, for some reason, upped his speed a little.

Maybe it’d be fun to chat up the gang while I took in the journey. In my mind, I formed the required network of thought. Right, what to\ntalk about…\n“Hey, um, Rigur? By the way…who was it that named your brother,\nanyway?”\n“Ah, thank you for recalling my name, Sir Rimuru! My brother was\nnamed by a passing member of the magic-born races.”\n“Oh? One of them visited a random goblin village?”\n“Indeed, Sir Rimuru, about a decade ago. I was still a child. He spent\nseveral days in my village…and he claimed to ‘see something’ in my\nbrother, in his words.”\n“Huh. Must’ve been a nice brother.”\n“Oh, absolutely!\n\nHe was my pride and joy.

Bet he’ll be pretty surprised at how much everything’s changed\nwhen he gets back!”\n“I imagine so, yes. Now, though, we serve you, Sir Rimuru. We may not\nbe able to follow Sir Gelmud to his honorable demon horde, but…”\n“Demon horde? Wow, he’s got one of those, huh? You sure he would’ve\nbeen willing to invite the rest of you guys, too?”\n“I am rather positive, actually. My brother evolved himself as a named\nmonster, but the changes that wrought were nothing compared to what you\nprovided us. Clearly, this evolution was on a different caliber. Heavens, I\nthought I would never hear the World Language once in my life. Such an\nhonor!”\nThe hobgobs listening in on us all nodded their earnest agreement. That\nkind of thing, huh? Naming someone evolves them, but how it turns out\ndepends on the namer…? I’d love to recruit someone to help me experiment\non that a bit. We could have a name-off. But…dang. A real-life demon horde. I knew there had to be one of those\naround here! Is the king of all demons going to attack us sooner or later? Actually, which side should we be on if that happens? Maybe I should save\nthat question for when it actually comes up, if it ever does. I already know there’s at least one “hero” out there, besides, so I’m sure\nthat king or whatever’s gonna be mostly focused on whoever that is. Not too\nsure the one Veldora told me about is alive after three centuries of\nretirement, but given how easy it apparently is to transmigrate and revive\nand so on around here, something tells me she’s still up in some mountain\nshack right now, training away. Better make a mental note of that Gelmud guy, at least.\n\nNow, next\nquestion. “Ranga!” I called out to the black wolf that was suddenly my biggest fan\nin the universe. “I’m kind of the guy who killed your father, aren’t I? You\ndon’t have any lingering, you know, resentment about that?”\n“I do have thoughts about it, my master. But to a monster, victory or\ndefeat in battle is the only absolute in life.

But…not only did my master forgive; he\neven gave me my once and future name for all time! I am filled with\nthankfulness, not resentment!”\n“Hmm… Well, if you want a rematch, I’m open any time.”\n\n“Heh-heh-heh… But, indeed, my evolution has made it all the clearer in\nmy mind! If you had unleashed your full force in our previous battle, the\nwhole of the pack would have been wiped out. We would have been lost to\nthe winds of time, never able to realize our dreams of evolution! Our\nloyalty, our devotion, belongs to our one true master alone!”\nAll…right? Certainly, in black snake form, I might’ve been able to do ’em all in\nwith one breath. But I didn’t want to have to try anything so risky. He’s\nreally thinking way too highly of me. Not that I mind him having the wrong idea, but…\n“You realized that, eh? Guess you really have grown a little!”\n“Ah-hah-hah! It pleases me to hear such words!”\nI nodded to myself. I mean, I killed his dad.\n\nThere’s no way he’s not at\nleast a little miffed about that. If Ranga wanted to exact his revenge\nsomeday, I’d gladly hold up my end of the bargain. He could definitely give\na black snake a run for his money, at least. We chatted a bit more as the road wore on. All of us were moving far,\nfar ahead of schedule. “Hey, you guys aren’t going too fast for your own good, are you?” I\nasked. “Not a problem, Sir Rimuru!” Rigur shot back. “Thanks to our\nevolution, perhaps! We are not terribly fatigued at all!”\n“Do not worry, my master!” added Ranga. “We are not wholly freed\nfrom the bonds of sleep as you are, but we do not require an extended\nperiod of rest! Nor do we need frequent stops for food. It will be no\nobstacle, even if we fast for several days!”\nI scoped out the rest of the crew. They all looked just as gung ho as\nwhen we set off.

Their leader is known as the Heroic King, and—”\nSomething about his shouty reply indicated that my speaking to him\n\nmade him terribly nervous.\n\nI was afraid he’d bite his tongue in his panic. According to Gobta’s account, the current king was Gazel Dwargo, third\nin his line from the original. A great hero, one whose might and presence\nmade the elder dwarves recall his grandfather in his younger years, but also\nan intelligent one who ruled his realm with a steady, even hand. A living\nhero, in a way. It had been a thousand years since Guran Dwargo, the first Heroic King\nof the dwarves, established this kingdom. Since then, his descendants had\ncarried on his will, preserving and developing his people’s history, culture,\nand technical skill. In a nutshell, that was Dwargon. Given how long its kings apparently\nlived, it must have been a hell of a place. Hearing about it got me excited. “In that case,” I asked, “how much longer will it take, Gobta?”\n“If I had to guess, we should arrive by the morrow, sir! The mountains\nare starting to loom high!”\nHe was right. The peaks weren’t even visible until yesterday. We were\nadvancing at an astounding clip. “I’ve just thought of something, Gobta—what errand brought you there\nin the first place? I thought you had merchants visiting the village\nregularly.”\nAs far as I had heard from Rigurd, there were bands of kobolds who\nstopped by on regular occasions. Why would a goblin want to take the twomonth journey over here, then? “Y-yes, sir! The dwarves pay high prices for magical weapons and\narmor, you see. They paid us with tools and such, but the merchants helped\nme carry them back, thankfully! None of the monsters around the village\ncould use that magical gear anyway…”\nAha. So they sold the weapons and stuff they found off passing\nadventurers? No wonder there was nothing decent left at the village. He\nmust’ve carted it all to the Dwarven Kingdom because the kobolds didn’t\nhave any way of appraising it on-site. Of course, any adventurers who’d\nlose to a bunch of goblins almost certainly must’ve been utter beginners, so\ninexperienced that they couldn’t even use a compass to keep from\nstumbling into monster villages.", "token_len": 661, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

Even the humans\n\nrecognize it as the best make in the land, and they gather at the kingdom to\nseek out the latest works, along with the subraces and intelligent monsters. It’s been tradition for years now, and all conflict between races is prohibited\nthere, in the name of the king.”\nSo we were traveling there less to sell some junk and more to buy the\ntools they needed. The fact that they could do so on neutral turf, without\ngetting laughed at by the other monsters, must’ve been another attraction. “Such an arrangement,” Rigur continued, “is made possible by the\nArmed Nation’s astonishing military might. As far as the kobold merchants\ntold me, the dwarven armies have not tasted defeat in a full millennium…”\nThe kingdom enjoyed the defenses of a massive, powerful, magic-driven\narmy corps and a wall of heavily armed infantry. Any would-be attackers\nwould find themselves first blocked by the infantry, then turned into dust by\na rain of offensive magic.\n\nThe equipment that backed up such an offensive juggernaut must have\nbeen very high-tech indeed, for this world. As Rigur put it, it was\noverwhelmingly superior to any human-made weapons or armor. I doubted\nanyone had the guts to mess with them at this point. It’d be the intelligent\nthing for a nearby nation to try to stay on their friendly side. No wonder\nnone of their visitors were stupid enough to squabble with any other\nmonsters within their territory. Still, dealing with any species, regardless of what they look like? The\ndwarves must be pretty chill dudes. Maybe I could make a few connections\nmyself. In fact, I’d better. This was a realm where people intermingled freely with monsters. A\nland that began with the surface city and extended down, down, down. A\nkingdom armed to the hilt that walked the path of peace.

This was a realm where people intermingled freely with monsters. A\nland that began with the surface city and extended down, down, down. A\nkingdom armed to the hilt that walked the path of peace. No place in the\nworld boasted as many weaponsmiths and merchants, and yet it sounded\nlike the farthest point in the universe from any kind of conflict. A bit ironic,\nmaybe.\n\nThe way the Dwarven Kingdom was starting to sound from these\nconversations, I couldn’t wait to arrive. Exactly three days after we began our journey, we reached the\ngrasslands at the foot of the Canaats. The city truly was beautiful—chiseled\ninto the vast mountain cavern, a natural fortress created by nature. It was the Armed Nation of Dwargon in all its mighty glory.\n\nAnd, of course, there was a line to get in. The front gate was enormous, built to block free entry into the vast cave\nopening. This gate opened only whenever the army went inside or out, and that, I\nheard, happened just once a month. Today it was firmly closed, but at the\nbottom of the great doors were two small entryways meant for regular\ntraffic. The right-hand one had nobody in front of it—probably meant for\nthe nobility or any other lofty figures who showed up. The door we were\nwaiting for was on the left, and while some people bore passes that allowed\nthem free entry, others had to undergo luggage checks in a separate\nchamber. All of this, of course, was guarded by a security detail whose\nequipment certainly reminded you that this was the Armed Nation. They\nweren’t clowning around. Once you were through security, you were pretty free to do what you\nwanted around the city, it seemed…but man, what a line. We were bound to\nspend more time waiting than traveling at this rate. “Guess we’re really here, huh?” a nearby traveler ventured as I scanned\nthe line of people down the corridor. “That’s a fancy gate.”\n“Look at the armor on that soldier!” his companion exclaimed. “We\nprobably couldn’t afford gear like that after ten years on my salary.”\n“Yeah, I’ll bet! Even the Eastern Empire tries to keep things peaceful\nwith these guys—in public, at least. With that kind of equipment, I see\nwhy.”\n“You said it. They sure ain’t gonna give you a second chance if you try\nanything. The blowback would be one hell of a headache for any nation that\ntried it!”\nMaybe the dwarves of this world weren’t the kind, gentle, almost\nlovable beings I was picturing.

They could be a lot more violent than that,\nfor all I knew.\n\nStill, as a free city and a hub of trade across races and\nspecies, it maintained at least a public face of neutrality. The fact that the\nHeroic King never allowed combat inside the city was fairly common\nknowledge among adventurers. I supposed that even in this world, you\ncould afford to be neutral only if you had the muscle to back it up. As I mused over this, I began hearing some more sinister voices.\n\n“Hey! Hey, check it out, there’re monsters out here! We can kill ’em,\n\nright? We aren’t inside yet.”\n“Yeah, what the hell’re you guys standing in line for? You think we’re\ngonna letcha do that, you little runts? Gimme your spot before we kill you! And leave your crap there, too, all right?

I’m sure we looked as if we had giant\ntargets painted on our asses. Now this pair of adventurers was accosting us,\nwhining about not liking our faces or whatever. “Hey, did you hear something, Gobta?”\n“Yes, I did…”\n“Did you run into any trouble last time you were here?”\n“Of course I did, sir! Ooh, they beat me silly! The kobold merchants had\nto pick me up off the ground! Might’ve died if they didn’t, eh?”\n“…They did, huh? So we can’t avoid this?”\n“It is, uhh, the fate of the weak…?”\nHe’d all but expected it. Sheesh, could’ve told me beforehand. Gobta\nhung his head, realizing what was in store for him. He was finally getting\ncomfortable talking to me. I was a bit worried this threat would make him\nflee back into his shell again. “Yo! You think you runts got a right to ignore us?!”\n“Hey, isn’t a talking slime pretty rare? Maybe we could get some money\noutta selling it.”\nThe adventurers kept yapping at us. People (maybe could have) said I\nhad the patience of a saint back home, but this was starting to irk me. “Gobta… You remember the rules I gave you all before?”\n“Y-yes, sir! Absolutely!”\n“Good.

Laying out some simple rules for my people, then promptly\nviolating every single one of them three days later wouldn’t exactly make\n\nme a role model. But with Gobta out of my hair, I was free once more to\ntake out the garbage. Just then, the hostile adventurer on the right shifted his gaze, and I\nfollowed it. It led to another group, a trio, grinning as they watched the\nspectacle unfold. One of my adversaries carried a sword; the other was clad in light armor. Bandits, I figured. The other three consisted of two robed figures—wizards\nor monks or something—and a big, brawny fighter. If I had to guess, they\nwere all in the same party, and these two were sent over to chase us out and\nnab our position in line while the other three finished us off and joined the\nothers as if nothing had happened. That kind of thing. A neat and easy way to pick off the weaker monsters and take their\npossessions. Nicely planned. Too bad they picked the wrong target! “Whoa, whoa, back of the line!” I said to rile them up. “I’m feeling\ngenerous today, so I’ll let all that slide if you line up out back!”\nThe duo looked stupefied for a moment. Then their faces turned bright\nred.\n\nDidn’t take much to tick them off. “What the hell’re you talking about, you little pissant?” one of them\nbellowed in his best evil-underling voice. “You wanna start something with\nus?!”\n“You’re dead! I promised you’d live if you just left all your stuff there,\nbut you know what? Now that you’ve pissed me off, that’s off the table.”\nHeh. Back in my contractor gig, I pushed people around that looked a\nhell of a lot scarier than these guys. I had to if I wanted to get any work\ndone. Some of the old rascals even had tattoos all over them. Compared to\nthat, this barely made me break a sweat. “Little pissant, huh? You mean me?”\n“Who the hell else am I talkin’ to?

I don’t know if the\nconcept of justified self-defense exists in this world…but it wouldn’t hurt to\nhave as much eyewitness testimony as possible.\n\nToo bad it didn’t look as if any of the humans were interested in lending\nme a hand.

Can’t believe how much friendlier the monsters\nwere. The people around us began edging away to safety. I supposed they\nwanted to keep from getting involved. The gate guards must have noticed as\nwell, because they were starting to hurry over. Keeping my eye on them, I casually rolled myself forward. “Heh-heh-heh… A piece of shit, huh? A slime? Where’d you get the\nidea that I was a slime, huh?”\nI let them fill in the rest themselves. Of course I was a slime. Anyone would’ve said so. “What? Cut the crap, man!”\n“Yeah! If you ain’t a slime, show me what you really are! It’s gonna be\ntough to make excuses once you’re dead!”\nThey were practically waiting for me to transform. Just like I’d hoped! I\nwas sure I could win as a slime, but it was kind of hard to hold back my\nskills. I’d be liable to slice each of them into two neat pieces with my Water\nBlades.

A black wolf.\n\nUm, hang on, wasn’t I a direwolf when I absorbed the boss and\ntransformed right after? Now I was just as dark as Ranga and his pack. If\nanything, I was actually larger than Ranga. That, and I had two horns on my head. Form: Tempest Starwolf. …Well. I guessed if a monster type I consumed evolved, my mimic form\nevolved with it. I was one level ahead of the evolved Ranga, even. After all,\nhe had only one horn. Less trivially, I felt a terrific amount of power well within me. I was sure\nthe sight would make these fools drop their swords and instantly run away. But they didn’t.\n\n“Hah!\n\nI don’t care how badass you look! You’re still a runty goddamn\npiss-slime to me!”\n“You think that was enough to freak us out? Come on, man!”\nThey aren’t picking up on this at all! You’re really supposed to by now,\nguys… I mean, don’t I look threatening enough? And even if you think it’s\njust an illusion, shouldn’t a shape-shifting slime give you at least a little\npause? And yet it didn’t faze them at all. Maybe they figured they still had their\nthree friends for backup. I had a few more skills on hand, too. Five, according to the Sage. Keen\nSmell, Thought Communication, Coercion, Shadow Motion, and Dark\nLightning. Shadow Motion was something Ranga and his pack were actually\npracticing at the moment. They could hide inside the shadow of their\npartner, then reappear on the spot whenever they were called. They were\nstill getting the hang of the “get inside a shadow” bit, so it’d likely be a\nwhile to come. Dark Lightning, meanwhile… That, I didn’t even have to test. If I tried it\nout now, my adversaries would be charbroiled, I was sure. I had\nunderestimated the stupidity of them both, so things could get ugly around\nhere.

Speaking of, what would happen to the form I was mimicking if I was\ndamaged? I did actually test that once—I deliberately kept getting myself\nattacked in armorsaurus lizard form. What I found was that once I took\nenough damage, I automatically reverted back to slime form—although the\ndamage would be applied only to the mimic, not to my slime body. I\nsupposed the magicules forming the mimicry also protected my body from\nthe blows. The restrictions I had to work with were the three-ish minutes I had to\nwait before switching to another form, and the magic I had to consume for\neach mimic type. But the magic wasn’t a problem, really, considering the\namount I could work with. In other words, I could let these guys flail at me all they wanted. Even if\nthey were a hell of a lot stronger than they appeared, I’d just revert to slime\nform and scoot off. Simple.\n\n“Hah! Prepare to die!”\nAnswering my call, the swordsman lunged at me with a shout. “Hrahh! Windbreaker Slash!”\nIs that a swordsman skill? The blade of his sword started glowing green. But it didn’t hurt me, sad to say… My hide snapped his mighty blade\ncleanly in half. As he attacked, his partner threw a set of three daggers at me. I\nappreciated the gesture—three at once had to be tricky to pull off—but none\nof them had enough force to even split a tempest starwolf’s hair. “What was that?” I sneered at them, trying my best to play the villain\nfigure. Really, though, what was that? I was completely undamaged. Was\nthat skill name just for show? “N-no! That pelt of yours… It’s too tough!”\n“It can’t be… I…I… It can’t be!

The swordsman\nsummoned magic blades of wind, his companion producing a shortsword to\nswipe at me with. Their heavy fighter shouted “Grandbreaker Slash!” as he\nhefted up a great ax and slammed it down. The wizard tossed a few fireballs\nmy way, and his monk friend built a magical defense for himself, expecting\nme to target him first. As parties went, it was rather well balanced. The only problem they had\nwas that none of their attacks did a thing against me. Once the dust settled, the group lifted their eyes, daring to take a look at\nme. They were too shocked to speak.

My Magic Sense skill started picking up on the dwarven security force\nrunning our way. “It’s over,” I whispered. Over, indeed. I looked down at them,\nwondering how they were ever going to clean up their undergarments after\nthis—trying to keep my new reality at bay for just a few more moments. “I’m really sorry about this!!”\nI bowed deeply—or intended to, anyway—inside the guardroom. After the ruckus we had caused, there was no way security was going to\nlet the lot of us off with a slap on the wrist. After only a few moments, a\nsquadron of guards was surrounding us. Well, me, really, given how\nunconscious the other five were.\n\nI know!\n\nI thought. I’ll just turn into a slime and slink off! And I tried to. But before I could move, they grabbed me en masse and—squish—lifted\nme up. So much for that. The soldiers flashed me their best “no struggling, now” smiles. The\nsweat running down their foreheads, however, indicated the effort they had\nto expend to make this arrest. “W-wait!” I shouted, doing my best frenzied-Gobta impression. “We\ndidn’t do anything! We’re the victims here!”\n“All right, all right,” came the smiling reply. “We’ll hear you out in the\nguardroom. Can’t expect to run off after that, now can you?”\nNot much else I can do, I guess. What’s Gobta doing? I glanced back,\nonly to find he still had his eyes closed and his hands over his ears. Oh,\nfor… What is he thinking? He’s not, clearly. He’s too stupid to. At least he\ntakes orders well. Luckily, I managed to shout loudly enough to attract his attention. Before long, we were all on our merry way to the security guards’ office.

He was still smiling at me—the expression suited this gruff, friendlylooking dwarf and his long, bushy beard. Except for those unfortunate veins\npopping out of his forehead. “Umm, why did you take me along with you, officer?”\n“You damned fool! What do you think you’re saying?

I’d told him that was just mimicry. He didn’t believe me? I\nthought I was pretty open with him.

This little back-and-forth between me and the soldier went on for\nanother two hours or so. ………\n……\n…\nBy the end of our intensive debate, I had just about an entire novel’s\n\nworth of backstory. A story about a forlorn young (and beautiful) girl,\nbrutally transformed into a slime by an evil mage. In the midst of our tit for tat, if you want to call it that, the soldier’s\nquestions helped me weave a grand story of heroic tragedy in my mind. I\nwas a young prodigy, a girl inherently gifted in the arts of transformation\nand illusory magic. A cruel witch had cast a terrible spell on me, and I was\ntraveling to rid myself of the curse. Why did this have to happen? And why did I turn myself into a magical\ngirl along the way?! And the worst part of it was, whenever I said\nsomething that wandered off-script, the soldier’s next question would help\nme fix the mistake. Oh, right! I’d say to myself as the tale meandered its\nmerry way down the path. By the end of it, both myself and the soldier were enthralled, hoping\nagainst hope that the girl would somehow succeed on her quest. Our eyes\nburned with passion—at least, his did. Truly, we had a connection that went\nbeyond mere words. “All right! That’s it for the report.

Before the soldier could finish, the large door behind him opened. Another soldier rushed in.\n\n“S-sir! An armorsaurus just showed up in the mines! It’s already injured\nseveral miners at their posts!”\n“What?! Well, did you defeat it?”\n“We’re good there! A suppression force is on its way. But some of the\nminers are fairly roughed up. I don’t know if there’s a war under way or\nsomething, but the city shops are out of medicine, and the castle won’t let\nus access their stockpile…”\n“What about our healers?”\n“That’s the thing, sir… The injured were deep inside, mining magic ore. The healers at the guardhouse are all out handling other calls, so all we have\nleft is a single novice!”\n“Ah, damn it all!”\nSounds rough. Not that I care. Just take some from the castle, if it’s that\nimportant! I thought, but…\nI do have a few potions on me, though. What should I do? It wasn’t as if I expected the gesture to testify to my character and get\n\nme off the hook. We just need to make the world a better place is all.

I’m done with you for now, but I can’t let you go yet. Stay in this room until things calm down a little!”\n“No, not that, um… I’ve got this.”\nI took a recovery potion out. Or spat it out, is the way he probably saw\nit. “…Um, what’s that?”\n“A recovery potion. Drink it, rub it in—it’s high quality!”\n“Eh? What’s a slime like you doing with that?”\nOh, come on. What happened to my story? Why’s he treating me like a\nslime again? He was egging me on during that entire interrogation, wasn’t\nhe?

How\nmany do you need?”\n“We’ve got six men down…but are you sure?”\nThe soldier who’d just stormed in gave me a quizzical stare. If I were\nhim, I probably wouldn’t take a potion from a monster, either. “Tch… Stay here, all right?\n\nLet’s go!”\n“Um? But, Captain, that’s a monster…?”\n“Enough from you! Just take me over to them!”\nThe bushy-bearded captain snatched up the six recovery potions I\nprovided and ran off. What with the grand fantasy tale we’d just woven, I\nsupposed I had gained his trust somewhat. Maybe he was a nice guy after\nall. Didn’t expect him to be a full-fledged captain, though. “Is it over?” Gobta asked after silently nodding at everything I’d said\nbefore now. “No, but I guess we’ll sit here and see what happens.”\n“Got it, sir!”\nThen we stared into space. The soldiers who peeked in on occasion\nwould give us confused looks, but otherwise, not much happened for an\nhour.

I didn’t think I’d ever work again, even if I\nsurvived… Thank you!”\n“……”\nThe last guy didn’t say anything before they all left, but I was fairly sure\nhe was thankful, too. Glad to see the potions worked. By this time, it was past sunset. It was almost fully dark outside when\nthe captain started talking with me again—seriously, this time. It turned out the quintet who’d tried taking me on were members of this\nnation’s Free Guild. They had talent, but they also had a prior reputation as\nrabble-rousers. “That oughta teach ’em a lesson!” the captain said with a\nroaring laugh. The guard was already certain that we were guilty of nothing, but I was\nstill being detained out of respect for the other “victims” I had inadvertently\ninconvenienced with my actions. Nobody was pressing charges, though—I\nsuppose they figured asking restitution for crapping their pants wasn’t the\nshrewdest of social moves. So I told him the truth. I was helping rebuild a goblin village, and we\nneeded arms and clothing, as well as someone who could provide a little\non-site guidance. The captain listened intently, some of his men chiming in\non occasion. They even asked Gobta a few questions, despite his darting\neyes and bewildered expression. The next day…\nWe were still in the guardroom. Gobta had borrowed another cell to\nsleep in, which I assumed he was still using. Having nothing better to do, I\nwas watching some dwarven personnel run through morning training in the\nfield behind the guardhouse. Swinging heavy wooden swords around to\nwork on their speed, sparring a bit in simulated combat, running a few laps,\nthe usual. I sat there, taking it all in and imagining how they’d fare against the\nassorted creatures I had Predated by this point. It was a bit like a game to\nme…but would the Sage mind if I used it like this? Seems like kind of a\nwaste of talent—but what the hell?\n\nIt’ll be fun. Turned out, the guards barely stood a chance.

Even if I gave myself a\n\nhandicap, there were only just a few of them who could beat the bat and the\nlizard. In a one-on-one matchup, the scales tipped pretty heavily toward the\nmonsters, but since the dwarves always seemed to operate in teams of four\nto six, a few of the combined parties could take on the spider fairly well. Even all twenty of them out in the field couldn’t take on the centipede,\nthough. I wasn’t expecting these guys to be Special Forces types, of course,\nso the results made sense to me. They were just about wrapped up by the time Gobta awoke. The captain\nchecked in at around the same time. “All right,” he said, “you’re free to go. Sorry I kept you in here for so\nlong—I was beholden to keep you overnight, at least. Apologies!”\n“Oh, no, no. It saved me one night’s hotel cost, at least.”\n“Glad you see it that way. Here, let me make it up to you. I can\nintroduce you to a talented blacksmith I know!”\n“That would be perfect. Thank you!”\nThings were looking up, finally. We just got priority entry, one—\ninspection, schminspection—and we had some extra money to spend. I\nthought finding a weaponsmith who wouldn’t rip me off at first sight would\nbe a chore, too, but a military referral was about the best I could ask for! Maybe I can afford to be a bit optimistic after all!\n\n“In exchange for that…”\nMmm? A catch? The only “catches” I ever liked were the ones on porn\nsites. “If you have any of those recovery potions left, would you be interested\nin letting go of them?”\nAha. They must really be short on them, huh? That soldier mentioned\nthat yesterday. Well, I’ve got a ton I could sell you guys…but I don’t really\nknow the going rate. Now what?\n\n…Ah, why not? I had a manufacturing cost of exactly zero on those\nthings anyway. If he wanted some, he could have some. “All right,” I replied. “It’ll depend on how many, though. I need to keep\na few for myself, too.”\n“Any extras you’re willing to part with are fine by me. Even if it’s just\none.”\n\nMm? Rather odd way of putting it, isn’t it?

Maybe times were just that tough. “Okay, um, well, how about five, then?”\n“Five! Ah, that’d be wonderful!”\n“Sure. Oh, also, I’m pretty sure they’ll still work even if you dilute them\na little bit, all right? If it’s just a regular slash wound, ten parts water to one\npart potion oughta do the trick.”\nThe captain nodded eagerly, fully convinced. I spat out my five potions,\nand he responded by giving me a small pouch. Inside I could see a selection\nof gold coins. “I know it’s not much,” he explained, “but I hope you’ll\naccept this. I’ll give you five gold pieces for each one of these!”\nTwenty-five gold, then? Fine by me. I don’t know if I’m undercutting\nmyself or not, but I’m not in a position to haggle. Better figure out how\nmuch that is, though, exactly. “Uhmm, if I could…”\n“Not enough? I’m doing my best here, sir…”\n“No, no, the price is perfectly fine, but I needed to ask you…”\n“Huh? It is?\n\nSo… So what did you need?”\nOoh. Mmmm, that’s not a good reaction. So I’m being ripped off after\nall? I knew I should’ve started higher. Oh well. The captain seems like a\nnice enough guy.

For the first time in a while, I enjoyed a meal.\n\nUgh… Why do I have to be so busy…? Kaijin the dwarf grumbled to\nhimself. What do they mean, the Eastern Empire might be on the move? That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard! He had reason to doubt it. Peace had reigned over the kingdom for three\nhundred years. The Empire had all the riches it could ever want—what\nmotivation could it possibly have to stage an invasion? That was what he\ndidn’t understand. Of course, Kaijin added to himself, I doubt the weaponsmiths of this city\nwould mind a good war to fill their coffers. But…arrgh, why is my work so\nbusy all of a sudden?!\n\nAnd that wasn’t his only problem. He scowled. Curse that damned minister! He rubbed his forehead as he\nimagined himself taking a hammer to the man and sighed. A lot of sighing\nlately. There wasn’t much time left. A refusal would damage his reputation. “I\ncan’t do it” wouldn’t be an excuse. He was waiting for some of his friends\nto get back to him, and depending on their reports, all could be lost. He had built a decent name for himself as a weaponsmith, but he wasn’t\nomnipotent. What kind of smith could craft weapons without any raw\nmaterials to work with? Finally, he heard the news he had been waiting for.\n\n“Sorry,” one said as he came through the door. “We wanted to contact\nyou yesterday, but we ran into one heck of a distraction…”\nThey were three men—dwarves, all brothers, the trio Kaijin had\nassigned mining duties to. The eldest was Garm, an armor crafter with long,\nmuscular arms. The middle child was Dold, who was known around the\nkingdom for his intricate handiwork. The youngest, Mildo, rarely spoke but\nwas skillful at almost anything he did—architecture, art, you name it. A sort\nof savant. Any one of them could’ve been talented enough to run a successful\nbusiness by himself—but they all had a critical disadvantage. Outside of\ntheir individual God-given talents, they were utterly hopeless, barely\ncapable of dressing themselves without an instruction manual.

That was how they wound up entrusting their shop to someone who\n\nstole it from them, falling into the trap of an apprentice jealous of their\nnatural talent, getting bullied by the government after they botched a\nministerial request… In the end, with nowhere else to go, they turned to\nKaijin, an old friend and practically a fourth brother to them in their youth. He wished they had called on him sooner, but that was neither here nor\nthere—they needed someplace to lie low, and he could use some help\naround the shop. The only problem was that Kaijin had no work for them. He was a\nmerchant dealing in battle gear, and he already had steady connections for\nall his merchandise except the weapons. Those he made himself, and he\nfigured he could keep the trio busy making the rest of his lineup…but he\ncouldn’t have them start immediately. Telling his armor and accessory\ncontacts out of the blue that their services were no longer needed would\nlead to easily avoidable trouble. Until things settled down a little, he would\nhave to continue with business as usual. Instead, with few other options available, Kaijin was having them direct\na team of laborers as they mined for ore and other materials. The brothers had arrived in Kaijin’s shop with a wild story about a\nmonster. It was the last thing he wanted to hear. He rubbed his forehead. “Well, at least you’re all fine,” he told them. “Glad you got away before\nyou were hurt at all!”\nAnd he was. If they weren’t injured, they could go right back to ore\ncollecting. His friends’ safety was naturally important, but…still. The three bothers gave each other awkward looks. “Well…we didn’t get away, exactly.”\n“No. In fact, we can still hardly believe what happened to us yesterday!”\n“………”\nThey moved on with the story—a tale of a mysterious slime who\nprovided them life-saving medicine. It seemed like a bunch of ridiculous\nravings, but these people weren’t ones to make up stories.\n\nThey didn’t have\nthe talent for it. So did the whole affair really happen?\n\nPerhaps it didn’t matter. It was\ntrue enough, he knew, that people had been attacked in the mines. And that\nmeant no mining for a while.

Their brethren were injured, no doubt.\n\nNow would be the perfect time to call on the services of the Free Guild,\nbut that was probably equally impossible. He had filed a mining request\nlong ago, to deafening silence. He knew he wasn’t the only one, either. A\nshortage was starting to rear its ugly head. Hiring guild members as mine guards wouldn’t accomplish much, either. They weren’t cheap, and even then, they didn’t lift a finger beyond what the\nguild paid them for. Guild guards did just that—guard—and nothing else. And if this was the kind of monster that could take out a B-minus-graded\nadventurer…\nIt was hopeless! There was no way to turn a profit. In fact, this would\nbankrupt him. Bah! Why did such a powerful monster have to show up in\nsuch a damned shallow part of the mine?! Kaijin let out a deep sigh. Now what?\n\nThere wasn’t much time left. Maybe he’d have to just go down there and grab the ore himself. No better\nideas were springing to mind. All that filled it right now was the passing\nticktock of his destiny. The four of them exchanged glances, all at a complete loss. That was\nright about when a set of rather odd-looking customers showed up.\n\n“Yo! You in there?!” shouted the captain—Kaido, as it happened. As we had conversed, we’d grown friendlier and friendlier with each\nother. We were on a first-name basis now, and it turned out his older brother\nwas in charge of the shop we were visiting. It was a cozy place, the kind where you’d expect the owner to be a gruff\nold man behind the counter. “Hello!”\n“Excuse us,” I said as I followed Kaido in. The moment we entered, we\nfelt several dubious gazes upon us. “““Ah!!”””\nThe three miners who had thanked me for saving them yesterday lifted\ntheir eyebrows high.

Didn’t look much like Kaido. “Whadda you want? You know these guys?”\n“Kaijin, this is it! The slime! The one who saved us…”\n“Yeah! It sure is! And you’re our boss’s brother, aren’t you, Captain?”\n“………”\n“Oh-ho! The slime, you say? We were just talking about you! Thanks\nfor getting these guys out of a bad way yesterday.”\n“Oh, no, it was nothing… Okay, it was something, but, ah, you know. Ha-ha-ha-ha!”\nIt should be against the law to compliment me. I always let it go to my\nhead, until I finally float up into outer space. I probably wouldn’t be coming\nback down for a while.\n\n“So,” the old guy said, rearing back a bit, “what brings you here today?”\nI decided to go into full detail. We all piled into seats situated deeper\ninside, and Kaido was kind enough to provide a quick recap for me. I added\na few choice details, and things moved along at a good pace. That younger one, though… Mildo, was it? I wish he’d say something. Like, how’s he managed to stay in conversations by saying nothing at all? It\nfloored me. “All right,” the old guy answered. “I understand. But what do you want? I can’t do anything for you. I’ve got a job from a certain country I gotta deal\nwith, too. None of this leaves the room, but…”\nThen it was his turn to talk, deliberately leaving out some of the finer\ndetails, as it was all classified. Basically, a number of countries were\nsending out orders for weapons and armor, spooked that a certain “idiot\nnation” might be trying to hatch a war on them all. It connected to why the\nguard was out of medicine yesterday, as well as the lack of raw materials\nplaguing the shops. “So,” he continued, tapping at his head, “I managed to pull an all-nighter\nto get an order for two hundred steel spears squared away…but I gotta\ncome up with twenty swords, too, and I ain’t even got one yet. There’s just\nno material!”\n“Why don’t you just say you can’t fill the order?” Kaido asked. “Fool!", "token_len": 670, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

But that damned minister Vester told\nme, ‘So you’re saying the great Kaijin, renowned across the entire\nkingdom, can’t even fill a simple order like this one? Is that it?’ In front of\nthe king himself, no less! Can you believe that damned idiot?!”\n\nIn between the cursing and the screaming, I learned that Mildo, the\ntaciturn third brother, had denied a request from Vester to build a house for\nhim. The minister had taken it personally, badgering him about it to the\npoint that Mildo had had to go into exile with Kaijin. Sounded like a stupid\ngrudge to have. So is this guy maybe buying up all the kingdom’s raw materials so the\nshops can’t sell anything? It sounds plausible to me. “What’s the difference between lances and swords?” I asked. “I need special ore for the swords,” the old guy spat out. “Magic ore. The spears are just simple steel spikes.”\nWithout the right materials to work with, even a master artisan is merely\na man. It must have been incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe minister must’ve been\nwaiting for him to show up, hat in hand, begging for mercy. “And that’s not the half of it. It takes a full day to complete even one of\nthose swords. Even if I built an assembly line and streamlined everything I\ncould, it’d still take me two weeks to make twenty…”\nI thought to ask about the deadline but stopped. I could read the answer\nin his face anyway. “I have until the end of this week.” He groaned. “First thing next week,\nI’m charged with delivering them to the king. It’s a task for the kingdom,\nand every shop has been asked to do the same. If I can’t, they could strip\nmy artisan’s license from me…”\nSo five days left, it sounded like. And it seemed doubtful that much\nwork would happen today, so four, basically? What a tough situation…\nWait, why am I here?\n\nNone of this has anything to do with me. And…um, hang on, did he say “magic ore”? I have some of that, don’t\nI? Not that it matters…\nThe next time I looked up, I realized that everyone was looking at me.

Old man… You think you could use this?”\nThen, with a small thud, I hand-delivered a quantity of extracted ore on\ntop of the work desk in front of me. Then I hopped on the sofa, lay back,\nand put my legs up (or felt like I did). “…Wait.\n\nWhoaaa! That’s magic ore!! And, my God, look at how pure it\nis!!”\nHeh. Not magic ore, man. Already processed it for ya. That’s a hunk of\npure magisteel! “C’mon, old man, your eyes giving out on you?” I asked. If\nthey couldn’t even see what this metal was, they couldn’t have been worth\nmuch. I’ll sell the materials to you, but that’s it. I’m running a business here,\nsort of. “What…? No… It can’t be! This entire piece is magisteel?!”\nHe finally noticed. His shock surprised me a bit. “You… You’ll let me have this? I mean, I’ll pay the going price for it, of\ncourse!”\nHeh-heh-heh. Gotcha! “Oooh, about that…”\n“Nggh, what do you want? I’ll do anything I can for this!”\n“Now that’s what I wanted to hear! You heard what me and my team are\nup to, right? I need your help finding someone who’ll travel to the village\nand give us some technical guidance.”\n“What? Is that all you need?”\n“Pfft. I need some connections to clothing and weapon suppliers, too. And armor.”\n“If that’s all it is, then of course!”\nAnd so old man Kaijin and I forged a verbal contract for the hunk of\nmagisteel. We agreed to iron out the details after his work was done. Judging by his reaction, I probably could’ve wrung him for a little more,\nbut no point being too greedy. Whenever I tried that, it always blew up in\nmy face. Even I learn from my mistakes sometimes. Kaido took his leave after we all finished with dinner.

The next day…\nEven though he had all the materials he needed, that deadline still\nlooked impossible to me. Time to come out with it. “You’ve got four days left, Kaijin. You think you can finish it up?”\n“…No, to be honest. But I gotta!”\nI didn’t think a can-do attitude was going to help much. What I did\nknow was that if something was impossible, it was simply impossible. It\ndidn’t become doable until all the right elements were in place. …Sheesh. I already got my foot in the door. Might as well go all in. “Well, I think I’ve got an idea. For starters, could you make just one\nsword for me? The best quality you can manage.”\n“What? But you’re a complete amateur. What could you do?”\n“I can’t tell you. But you gotta believe me! If you don’t, then go ahead. Keep going. You’ll probably lose your license, but…”\n“…So I can trust you? Because if I can’t, you better not expect payment\nfor that magisteel. I won’t be able to take care of myself, much less cover\nyou… You keep your promise, though, I swear I’ll keep mine. I’ll give you\nthe best swordsmith this kingdom has!”\nWe have a deal. And promises are made to be kept. Off we went into the workshop.\n\nI owed Kaijin one for letting me rest in\nhis spare apprentice’s chamber anyway, so I wanted to hold up my end of\nthe bargain. When we entered, we found the three brothers staring at the hunk of\nmagisteel on the table, sighing to themselves as they turned it over in their\nhands, scrutinizing every surface.

The chunk I’d spat out was about the size\nof a fist. Was it that rare? They sure acted that way. “What are you talking about?” Kaijin exclaimed when I asked about it. And according to his explanation—\n\nMagic ore was a raw material that was refined to make magisteel. Even\nthe base ore could rival gold in value, for a simple reason: It was both rare\nand useful for a variety of applications. It all came down to the magicules that seemed to form nearly everything\nin this world—something that Earth seemed to do just fine without but that\nplayed a huge role over here. On rare occasions, when a monster was defeated, it would drop an entire\nchunk of magicules, referred to as “magic stone.” This was a sort of\nportable energy source, and it served as the fuel for something called “spirit\nengineering,” an invention exclusive to this world. Magic stones came in\nlevels of purity, and the purer ones were used as cores inside assorted\nproducts. Even ornaments could harness this energy for special effects. The\nresulting clothing and accessories could boost the wearer’s abilities, grant\nthem additional effects, and do any number of other things. Now, the main difference between plain old ore and magical ore was\nthat the latter could be obtained only in areas where higher-level monsters\nlurked. It required the combination of regular ore, a large concentration of\nmagicules, and eons of time for the ore to absorb the magic and make the\ntransformation—a sort of geological mutation. Of course, any place with a lot of magic also tended to have a lot of\nmonsters. Not the run-of-the-mill kind adventurers could kill for pocket\nchange—you wouldn’t find any magic ore around them. You’d have to\ntravel to places with at least B-ranked monsters in them. As a tangent, Kaijin finally gave me a full description of how the\nranking system worked for monsters. “Ohhh!” I said.\n\n“So I’d be, like, a B or so, maybe?”\n“““……”””\nI imagined everyone was thinking the same thing. Except for Gobta,\nwho was a little slow.\n\nLet’s leave him alone for now. Regardless, the point was that magic ore didn’t just pop up out of\nnowhere. What’s more, the magisteel extracted from it took up 3, maybe 5\npercent of its total mass. Even a fist-sized chunk of that steel was worth at\nleast twenty times its weight in gold. It also appeared that prices, in general, averaged out to near the same as\nthey did in my old world. Gold was used as currency because it was worth a\nlot, just like back home. As a result, all the countries had adopted gold as a\ncurrency standard.", "token_len": 707, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

As a result, all the countries had adopted gold as a\ncurrency standard.\n\nI kept the fact that I had a huge store of these magisteel hunks in my\nstomach a secret. Honestly, it was getting a little frightening.\n\nNo way they\ncould’ve known, but…what if they had? Or was that just my paranoid,\nlower-middle-class upbringing coming out?\n\nNow, on to the real issue. Magisteel was rare, certainly, but that wasn’t what made it so valuable. That lay in how readily adaptable it was to serving as a conduit for magical\nforce. One could control magicules through the power of imagination, to some\nextent. My Magic Sense skill worked that way, but even Control Water\nworked by manipulating the ambient magic around me. Most monster skills\nharnessed it one way or another as well. I didn’t know that much about\nmagic spells, really, but I figured they worked on the same premise. So what happened if a weapon was made of material infused with vast\namounts of magic? Amazingly, it became a weapon that could mature! How classic! Aw, man, now I want one! I almost said so out loud before\nstopping myself just in time. I mean, think about it—a sword that gradually\nmolded itself to your ideal shape based on what you wanted from it. Depending on your own magical force, you might even be able to transform\nit midbattle! And since it was so compatible with magic, it’d help boost\nyour skills, too. Basically, unless you were really handy with a weapon, you were always\ngoing to be better off with a magically infused one. But what if—although\nthis would take a lot of skill and money—you made a blade of pure\nmagisteel and inserted a magic stone into it? Could you make, like, flame\nswords and blizzard swords and stuff? My creative juices started flowing. My heart sang, demanding Kaijin\nmake one right this minute. But I would have to be patient. The next magic\nstone I get my hand on, though… For sure. After that quick lesson, Kaijin buckled down and went to work. I\nwatched him as his would-be young apprentice. Gobta was probably\nsleeping somewhere, besides…\nSwords, of course, came in a wide array of shapes and sizes.

I, of course,\npictured a Japanese-style katana as the strongest one out there—but even\n\nkatanas came in all kinds of shapes. That was what made me so curious\nabout the kind of sword he’d make. Ten hours later, he was finished. It looked, to me, like a plain old longsword. And—whoa, that was a lot\nof magisteel left. And here I was worried whether a fist-sized lump would\nbe enough for even one. Turned out Kaijin couldn’t even guess how much\nit’d cost to use 100 percent magisteel on everything. I suppose not. No\nwonder nobody’s come up with a flame sword or a blizzard sword or even a\nthunder sword. It’d cost too much.\n\nMakes sense. Instead, magisteel formed only the core of the weapon, and the rest of\nthe blade was crafted from regular steel instead. That core was all it needed\nfor its magic to work its way into the steel, eventually merging itself with\nthe whole sword. That, he said, was why a weapon grew stronger as it was\nused over time. The blade would never rust or lose its shape—it could just\nuse ambient magicules to regenerate itself. Oddly enough, though, even these magic swords had their life spans. If\nthey were bent too far or otherwise warped beyond recognition, the magic\nwould leak out, leading to rapid weathering. Kaijin showed me his freshly forged sword as he spoke. It was all so\ninteresting to me. I took the weapon in hand as I marveled over it—all right,\nnot in hand, but close enough. It was simple in make, straight as an arrow. No bells or whistles. It wasn’t meant strictly for slicing like a katana, but\nthe blade seemed suited to slashing. But this was just a base. Over time, I supposed, the sword would adapt\nitself to whatever its user wanted from it. No wonder the forger kept things\nsimple. Okay. So Kaijin and his team had crafted this lovely sword for me, as\npromised. Now it was my turn.\n\n“Right!” I said. “Time for me to pull a little secret work for you. I’m\nsorry, but would you all mind leaving me alone here for now?”\nThere was no way I could let them see this. It would be too hard to\nexplain, for one thing. “Well, you have everything you need here, I suppose. But are you sure? I would be glad to help.”\n“I’ll be fine, thank you!

Just promise me you won’t peek into this room\n\nfor the next three days. Swear it!”\n“All right. I’ll trust you and wait…”\nWith that, Kaijin and his men left. Gobta, too, for some stupid reason. What goes through his mind, day in and day out, that keeps him alive? I’ve\ngot to wring it out of him someday. So our recipe today’s for a longsword. Couldn’t be simpler! First, take\nthis completed sample…and swallow it up! Next, take the rest of the\ningredients lined up here…and swallow them up, too! Munch, munch…\ngulp!\n\nMix well in your stomach, and…\nNotice. Analysis target: “longsword.” Successful. Creating copy…\nSuccessful. Repeat nineteen times. Bon appétit! Easy, wasn’t it? Kids, don’t try this at home! And with that ridiculous mental commentary, I set to work. Yikes… Each copy was taking, like, ten seconds. 190 seconds—three minutes and change—and I had nineteen swords\nscattered around the room. It had been maybe five minutes since I shooed\nKaijin and the rest out of the room. I mean, I figured I could do it, but it was just so easy! And people spent\nentire lifetimes crafting stuff like this. I started to feel as if I had done\nsomething shamelessly rude to them. This Predator is such a cheat code. So now what? I told them not to open the door for three days. Am I\nsupposed to just hole up in here until then? No… I can’t just sit here like the\nblob that I am. Maybe I should come clean…\nSo I did. I threw the door open and stepped outside. The four dwarves\nimmediately stood up, giving me worried looks. Gobta was…sleeping. God, five minutes?\n\nYep. That was when I decided I had to do something\nabout him. “Wh-what is it? Did something happen?”\n“Are you short on something?”\n\n“Or…or it didn’t work, then?”\n“Yeah, um…well, actually…” I sized up the dwarves, whose eyes were\nladen with self-torment. They hurt to look at. But I just couldn’t resist. I had to put on an act. Why did I have to be so mean to people all the time?

Wouldn’t want them banned\nfrom the premises. Just sit tight, let it pass, and—\n“Hey… You think you can just pick on us all you want?!”\nWith an audible kick at the table, Kaijin stood up. “You think you can run around and make fun of my guest, Vester? You\nthink I’m not gonna mind that?\n\nYou think?!”\n…Um? Hey, Kaijin, this is a top government official and stuff, isn’t it? You sure you’re on good footing here?

It’ll be great working with you,\nKaijin!”\nIt would be. We could hammer out the details later. If Kaijin was willing\nto come over, I was more than willing to invite him. We didn’t need no\nfancy contract! We do what we want, when we want! Kaijin and I sealed the deal with an emphatic nod. Just one thing… How were we gonna book it out of here? Maybe a little\nprudence wasn’t such a bad idea after all. You create a lot of problems for\nyourself otherwise. All the bravado in the world wasn’t going to solve them,\n\nwas it? So. As anyone could imagine, punching a government minister in the face\npresented a number of issues. “My brother, my brother,” muttered Kaido, a few security officers\nbehind him. “What did you do this time?”\nHe was on duty today—not even he could get away with skipping shifts\nall the time. Kaijin had given him an invite, but he’d refused…only to come\nto the nightclub anyway thanks to his brother’s boorishness. Simply running\nwould have been an easy enough plan for us, but chances were it’d be\ndoomed from the start. “Hmph! That fool!” As four knights dragged Kaijin away, he shouted\nand pointed a wild finger at the minister. “He practically spat in the face of\nRimuru, my client and the best patron I’ve ever had! What’s so bad about\nputting him in his place a little, huh?!”\nVester, for his part, hadn’t overcome the shock yet. He was simply\nstaring at us, blood still dribbling from his nose. It looked both pathetic and\na little comical. Never saw it coming, I guess.\n\nThe surprise probably kept it\nfrom even hurting. “Brother,” Kaido whispered with a sigh, “you don’t put a government\nminister ‘in his place’ like that… Either way, you’re all coming with me!”\nHe nodded to his men, then took me aside for a moment. “Just stay calm, all\nright?", "token_len": 662, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

Instead, he was atoning for his\nsundry idiotic behavior by undergoing what I liked to call “bagworm hell.”\n\nI’d thought about hanging him by his feet at first, but that just seemed like\ncruelty for cruelty’s sake, so instead I’d tied him up with Sticky Thread and\nlet him hang from the ceiling. “Wait!” he’d whined. “This is so mean, sir! I want to come with you!”\nI’d showed him no mercy this time. “Enough, you fool! I can’t take any\nmore of your blockheaded behavior! If you don’t like it, summon your\ntempest wolf buddy and have him help you out!”\nNot that he could do it, I figured as I shut the door behind me.

I thought I was, for a moment. But it\nwas all right. He could deal. The five us of were taken to the royal palace. Not that we were under\nvery heavy guard. If anything, it seemed entirely voluntary. We wound up having to spend around two days in the castle jail room. It\nwasn’t so bad—the food looked decent, and we had all the comforts we\nneeded in the place. It was less like a jail cell and more like an urban\napartment shared by the five of us. We weren’t treated too terribly, either. “I just had to lose my temper, and now I’ve got all of you in here with\nme… I’m so sorry, guys!” Kaijin apologized. But none of his dwarven friends minded too much, either. “It’s fine, Kaijin! No problem at all!”\n“Yeah, don’t worry about it, boss!”\n“……”\n“Besides, once we’re released, we want to come with you, Kaijin!”\n“Yeah, can we come with you, Rimuru?”\n“……?”\nI wasn’t observant enough to tell what the third one wanted from me, but\nI got the gist well enough. “Hah!\n\nSure, we’ll take care of all of you! You better be ready, though…\nOnce we reach the village, you guys’re gonna work!”\n“Got it!”\nWe were already talking about life outside the big house. As prison\n\nterms went, it was pretty chill.

Was there some reason for it?”\nKaijin’s expression immediately soured.\n\nWith a sigh, he began to\nexplain. It turned out he used to be a captain in the palace’s royal knight\ncorps—a leader of one of the seven armies making up the whole system. Three corps were devoted to behind-the-scenes work like engineering,\nsupply, and emergency aid. Three more—heavy strikers, magic strikers, and\nmagic support—played more of a starring role. The last one, and the most\nimportant, was the king’s personal guard. Kaijin had been head of the\nengineering corps, and Vester had been his second-in-command. “He was the son of a marquis,” the dwarf moaned. “A noble title he\nbought with money. I think he must’ve been jealous of a commoner like me\ntaking the head role. It was complicated, you know? It must’ve been\nhumiliating to him, taking orders from someone below him. And I’ll admit\nthat I didn’t care much about what other people thought about me.\n\nI was too\nbusy trying to stay on the king’s good side. That’s when it happened.”\nThe “magic-armor affair.”\nAt the time, the engineering corps was seen as the lowest of the army’s\nseven departments—barely producing any new technology for itself. Vester\nbelieved a kingdom rich in technology should have an appropriately famous\ncorps of engineers, while Kaijin was more of a status-quo man when it\ncame to research and development. Despite how intense their arguments\ngot, they never managed to reach an agreement during their countless\ngarrison meetings. Along the way, the corps launched a so-called magic-armor soldier\nproject with a team of elf engineers. Vester was hell-bent on making this\nproject a success and boosting the corps’s position in the military pecking\norder. Kaijin warned him that he was proceeding too quickly with it, but\neven then, Vester had little time for the advice of a common-born man.

As head of the engineering corps,\nKaijin wound up taking the heat for it, resigning from his position in the\narmy. Not only did Vester make Kaijin the scapegoat; he even convinced his\nfriends among the higher-ranked leaders to give false testimony against\nhim. That, according to Kaijin at least, was the truth. Once he finished, Kaijin let out a tired sigh. I could understand his perspective.\n\nThere must’ve been a lot of\nresentment built up over the years from that. Still…man, Vester’s just a total storybook villain, isn’t he?\n\nThey don’t\ncome easier to spot than that. As far as the minister was concerned, Kaijin\ncould make a comeback in the military and threaten his position at any\ntime. That kind of thing. Didn’t he deserve the death penalty, really? Maybe not, but…\n“So,” Kaijin concluded, “maybe he’ll settle down a bit if I leave the\ncountry for a while.”\nHe sounded a bit forlorn about it, but at least he had backup. The three\nbrothers with us were just as aware of the truth, and there was no love lost\nfor Vester among them, either. Hell, even I hated him now. Still, Kaijin did sock a noble, so I kind of wondered whether they were\njust gonna release us and wave good-bye. “I wouldn’t worry about it,” Kaijin reassured me. “I’m out of the army\nnow, but I did make it up to the corps leader. As far as my social position\ngoes, I’m just below baron. If it were strictly commoner versus nobleman in\nthe courts, well, hanging might’ve entered the picture.”\nHe accentuated that morbid fact with a hearty laugh. Meanwhile, I just sat there.

Our day in court arrived soon after, and the entire lot of us were brought in\nfront of the monarch. The Heroic King of the dwarves.\n\nNow that I was seeing him in person, his stately aura was almost awe\ninspiring. His Majesty Gazel Dwargo closed his eyes and sat deeply upon his\nthrone. He was stocky, dwarflike in appearance, and his exposed armor-like\nmuscles positively radiated energy. His skin was a deep, dark brown, and\nhis black hair was pulled back on his head. He exuded pure strength. My fight-or-flight instincts kicked in all the\nway for the first time in ages. Two knights were stationed near him, one on each side. They were\nequally muscle-bound, no doubt, but they still looked wispy compared to\ntheir ruler. Seriously, this guy was a monster. I’d been planning to beat a\nhasty retreat if I needed to, but now… Not so much. The moment I was\nplaced in front of him, my every nerve was wound taut. It might have been the first time in this world that I actually sensed a\nclear danger to myself. A man knelt in front of the king, checking over something with him. After receiving permission, he stood up and read the affidavit. “We will now begin the trial! Silence, everyone!”\nFor the next hour, both sides presented their cases. As criminal suspects,\nwe weren’t allowed to speak—in the royal court, that right was reserved for\nthose with a rank of earl or greater. Otherwise, you needed the king’s\nexpress permission. If you did speak out of turn, that apparently proved\nyour guilt on the spot and earned you a bonus contempt-of-court charge. Whether you were innocent or not, that was the way this place worked. We were stuck having our representative speak for us. He had paid us a few\nvisits during our two days in custody, discussing the nature of our case. Our\nkind-of lawyer, basically.\n\nCould we trust him, though? Anxieties like that had a tendency to crop\nup for a reason…\n“So there Sir Vester was,” he continued, “sitting back at this club and\nenjoying an alcoholic beverage, when this gang pushed their way into the\nplace and exposed him to dreadful violence! This is not the kind of behavior\nthat should ever be forgiven!”\n“Is that the truth?”\n“It is, my liege!\n\nI heard it from Kaijin himself, and I also have written\ntestimony from the owners of the club.

There can be no mistaking the\n\ncourse of events that night!”\n…Um, what? What did he just say? I thought he was on our side, and it\ntook all of five minutes for him to go turncoat. That can’t be good, can it? I shot a look at Kaijin—his face turned bright red, then slowly began\ndraining of color. I’ll bet. Our lawyer wasn’t even bothering to make excuses for us. It went without saying that representatives for the accused weren’t\nallowed to lie in court. If they were found out, that would be another\nhanging. It was impossible to think any would-be lawyer would attempt it,\nbarring extreme circumstances, and yet ours was doing it right in front of\nus. “My liege!” Vester exclaimed, egging him on. “You have heard it for\nyourself! I beg of you to deal with these miscreants harshly!”\nHe flashed us a smile of supreme confidence. Bastard.\n\nMaybe I should’ve hit him after all. The king remained motionless, eyes closed. In his place, one of the\nguards beside him spoke. “Order!\n\nI will now give the verdict! Kaijin, the mastermind behind this\ncrime, is sentenced to twenty years of labor in the mines. His accomplices\nare sentenced to ten years of labor in the mines. With that, this court is\nhereby—”\n“Wait,” a deep, quiet voice interrupted. The king opened his eyes and looked at Kaijin. “It has been a while, Kaijin. Do you remain in good health?”\n“…Yes, my liege!” came the instant reply. Presumably he had the right\nto speak now. “It gladdens me that you remain so as well!”\n“Yes. Now, do you and your friends”—looking at us—“have any desire\nto return to us?”\nThe audience in the royal court murmured among themselves. It must\nhave been an unusual development. Vester immediately blanched. Our\ntraitorous representative, meanwhile, had developed a deathly pallor. “I beg your forgiveness, my liege, but I have already found a master to\nserve! I have made my vow, and it has become my treasure. A treasure so\nfine that, indeed, not even the direct order of my liege could make me part\nwith it!”\nThis clearly angered the audience.

I could see the guards staring daggers\n\ninto Kaijin’s forehead. But he stood strong—chest puffed out, the picture of\ndignity. The king, seeing this, closed his eyes again. “I…see.”\nSilence ruled for another moment. “I have made my decision. Listen well to my sentence! Kaijin and his\nfriends are hereby exiled from the kingdom. After midnight tonight, when\nthe new day comes, they are officially no longer welcome in my lands. That\nis all. Begone at once!” Opening his eyes, the king made his proclamation\nin a loud voice. Ah, the dignity of a born leader! His overwhelming presence sent\nshivers through my body. Although, being king around here seemed like a\nterribly lonely job to have. So there we were, after the trial, back at Kaijin’s shop. That little\ncelebratory drink we wanted to get sure broke bad, didn’t it? Now we had to\npack up and leave for good. Oh, wait, is Gobta all right? We’re still only at day three with him,\nright? I was a tad nervous about that as I opened the door to his punishment\nroom. “Ooh! Welcome back, sir! Did you have fun? Gee, sure hope you take\nme with you next time!”\nThere he was, leaping up off the sofa to greet me! How did that\nhappen…? He couldn’t have gotten out of my spider silk that easy! Taking another look, I realized that the cushion Gobta had been using on\nthe sofa was actually a tempest wolf. Wait, seriously? He actually\nsummoned the guy? “Uh, Gobta, how’d you get that wolf in here?”\n“Oh! Right!\n\nThat! I just thought to myself, ‘Hey, can you come on over,\nplease?’ And he did, sir!”\nHe made it sound so easy, the bastard. None of the other hobgoblins had\nmanaged the feat from such a long range before. Maybe his brain cells were\nall devoted to his natural talents instead of, you know, actual intelligence. It\nseemed crazy to me.\n\nI concluded that it must’ve been a coincidence. I then realized that the sight of the tempest wolf had frozen the dwarves\nin their tracks. “What’s wrong?” I asked. “We need to start packing, don’t\nwe?”\n“W-wait a second!” the panicked Kaijin replied. “What on earth is a", "token_len": 697, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

You need to run! That’s a B-ranked monster!”\nAnd now they were panicking. They looked so ridiculous, I was actually amused. “Oh, he’s fine! Really! No problem! He’s like a big dog, really! We keep\nhim indoors and everything!”\nMy attempts at calming everyone’s nerves met stony silence. Black direwolves, by the way, were a somewhat advanced version of\nregular direwolves. If they evolved in a more magic-oriented fashion, their\nfur would turn black. The coats of the tempest direwolves were black as\nwell but with a uniquely colored sheen. Direwolves weren’t really supposed to evolve toward the “storm”\nelement in the first place—that was just a side effect of the name I gave out. In volcanic regions, direwolves would evolve with a fire element and\nbecome red direwolves. Near bodies of water, you would find blue\ndirewolves. In the forests would be green direwolves. In other words,\nadopting elements was a fairly common evolutionary pattern for these guys. The magic-infused black ones, meanwhile, were apparently a notorious\nthreat to any nearby humans and humanoids. The tempest element gave our\nwolf pack an ever-so-slight purplish shine to their black color, something\nyou wouldn’t notice if you weren’t paying attention. Sorry I spooked the dwarves, I guess.\n\nWe didn’t have the time for me to\nexplain the whole story. I’ll just call him Gobta’s pet for now and move on. After hurriedly pressing the dwarves to put on their best traveler’s\noutfits, I pushed them out of the shop, went back in by myself, and\nproceeded to swallow up the entire contents of the building. Capacity-wise,\nI was still A-okay, but swallowing the building whole would probably have\ndrawn a little too much attention, so I kept it at that. Once our preparations for the journey were complete, we made our way\nto where Rigur and the other goblins were waiting. The space was silent, a far cry from the loud arguing of a moment ago.

Vester nervously swallowed.\n\nThe persistent\n\nsilence of the king put both him and everyone else on edge. Then Gazel shattered the stillness. “Now, Vester. Do you have anything you wish to say?”\n“A—a thousand pardons, my liege, but this is all a misunderstanding! It\nsimply must be a mistake!”\nVester’s voice was a nervous warble as he pleaded his case. The king\nregarded him coldly, betraying none of his emotions. “A misunderstanding? If it is, then it has cost me one of my most\nfaithful servants.”\n“How can you say such a thing, my liege?! You call what he offered to\nyou ‘faithfulness’? Why, he is simply a man off the street—”\n“Vester. I see you are mistaken. Kaijin left my corps on his own volition. When I speak of a faithful servant I have lost…I refer to you.”\nThe minister’s heart raced. I need to find an excuse… But his mind was\nblank. The words refused to come to his lips. His thoughts were slow to\nform. What did he just say?\n\nHe referred to me? Then…\n“Let me ask you once again, Vester. Do you have anything you wish to\nsay?”\nFear, pure fear, dominated Vester’s head. The king had asked him a\nquestion.\n\nHe needed to reply. But all his speech had abandoned him. “I… My liege, I am afraid…I…”\n“I had great expectations for you, Vester. I have been waiting for so\nlong. Even during the magic-armor affair, I waited for you to finally speak\nthe truth. And now I find that, yet again…”\nThe expression Gazel showed Vester could almost be described as one\nof kindness. The king’s words pierced through the minister like the sharpest\nof swords. “Look at these.”\nThe king pointed out two items one of his attendants had produced. Vester, eyes hollow, looked at them. One was a sphere filled with a liquid\nthat he had never seen before; the other was a single longsword. “Do you know what these are?”\nThe liquid remained a mystery to Vester, but the longsword he\nremembered.

The following\nspeech took a fairly long time for Vester to fully understand.\n\nThe liquid was a life-regenerating elixir, a near-perfect extract of the\njuices of the hipokute herbs. A so-called “full” potion, named for its\nmiraculous recovery properties. Even with the best technology the dwarves had at their fingertips, the\npurest extract they could produce topped off at 98 percent. That made it\nonly as potent as a “high” potion. This liquid, meanwhile, was at 99\npercent! Vester’s face twisted in shock. He had to know! What did they do to\nproduce such a level of—? But before he could ask, the attendant had even\nmore shocking news for him. The longsword had a core of magisteel that\nwas already working its way through the rest of the blade. Impossible. That process began only after a ten-year adaptation\nprocedure! The shock set Vester’s mind reeling.\n\nIf this was true…! “Both of these wonders were brought about by that slime,” the king said. “And thanks to your behavior, we have lost our connection to such a\ncreature. Do you have anything you wish to say?”\nNow Vester realized the full extent of his king’s rage. There was truly\nnothing he could say. “I… I do not, my liege.”\nTears began welling in his eyes. He knew it all too well now—his lord\nhad abandoned him. All he wanted was to serve his king. To win his\napproval. That was it. When did I go wrong? When I grew jealous of Kaijin,\nor before…? He didn’t know. All he knew was that he had betrayed the\nking’s trust. “I…see. In that case… Vester! I hereby forbid you from entering the\npalace. Do not let me see you before me again. I shall leave you with this: I\nhave tired of you!”\nHearing his words, Vester stood up and bowed deeply to his lord. Then\nhe left, setting off to pay his penance for his foolishness. As he did, a guard ran forward and arrested the representative serving as\nVester’s accomplice. The king watched them out of the corner of his eye. “My dark agent!” he\nshouted with some urgency. “Track the movements of that slime!\n\nDo not let\nit escape your notice.

Who was that slime? A type of monster, no doubt. Was that the level of monster being\nreleased, then? His hero’s instincts were giving him a feeling he couldn’t ignore. Trusting it, he began to take action. Rigur and gang were all safe at the edge of the forest. Between this and that, we had spent a total of five days in the city—\npretty much what we expected. Things didn’t quite go according to plan,\nbut we largely accomplished what we’d set out to do. Too bad we didn’t get to hit the Free Guild in town.

Either this was a well-practiced routine of theirs, or Ranga really did\nscare them that much. There had to be something I could do. “Hang on, Ranga,” I said. “I tried transforming into one of you guys\nearlier, and I’d like to test out how it works a bit. That’s why I want you to\nlet these dwarves on, all right?”\nHis head immediately shot up. “I understand, my master!”\nKaijin and Garm, eldest of the three brothers, would go on my back;\nRanga would take Dold and Mildo.

The rest of the tempest\nwolves grew equally excited. Always a good idea to motivate the troops a\nbit. So I turned to Kaijin and Gharm to get them to hop on, and…\nWell, that’s weird. They’re all unconscious and foaming at the mouth. What’re these guys doing, anyway? Oh well. I knew that practice would\ncome in handy! A little Sticky Thread off my back, and everyone was\npulled up and put firmly in place. Success! Fainted dwarves wouldn’t make great traveling companions, but either\nway, we were off.

I gave the call, and he came over for me!”\nThere was a fighting spirit in everyone’s (and every dog’s) eyes now. “…It’s not impossible,” Rigur reflected. “Gobta is strong enough to\nhave done the Dwarven Kingdom journey round-trip on foot once!”\nOh, right… I thought he was a slobbering idiot, but apparently he was\ngood in a pinch.

On that front, the tempest starwolf seemed to have nearly\neverything I could want. With the Sage’s support, this wolf could probably insta-kill the black\nsnake from back in that cave—no skills required. I’d learned in town that\nthe lizard rated a B-minus in rank, and from there, I used the Sage’s\nsimulation skills to figure out how the rest stacked up against it. It told me that the black snake wasn’t even an A, and I could win against\nten of those centipedes at once, so I’d be an A-minus or so? Sounds about\nright. A tempest starwolf not under my control would be stronger than a black\nsnake, though it probably couldn’t take ten at once. Although there was that\nweird Dark Lightning skill to think about…\nMy instincts told me that one would pack a punch, so I’d test it out in\nslime form first. That ought to temper it a little bit so I can observe it. The Dark Lightning I unleashed was… Let’s call it “beyond belief.”\nThere was a flash, followed by a deafening roar of thunder. The large\nriverside boulder I chose as a target was gone, crumbled to pebbles. I could\nsee the bolt crashing down faster than light…but witnessing its dreadful\nforce for myself simply amazed me. Way beyond expectations. Heh-heh-heh… Let’s pretend that didn’t happen! I made my decision\ninstantly. Right!\n\nI wasn’t doing anything! Just a little lightning storm. Let’s leave it at that.

The entire twenty-yard radius around the\ndisintegrated boulder was now blazing hot and glassy. Something to think\nabout. Rigur, of course, had a few hobgobs there in short order to find out what\nwas going on. I told them it was just a rogue thunderbolt. Sorry for\ninterrupting your sleep, guys.

According to the results, a tempest starwolf out of my control\ncould use Dark Lightning and probably kill ten black snakes at once. Which\nmeant the attack was probably past A rank. The guidepost for an A rating was being able to destroy a small town\n—“disaster” level, in other words. Better avoid that transformation around\nurban areas.

The dwarves were up, still white as sheets. “You all right?”\n“Y…yes… Where are we?”\nAs they slowly shook out the cobwebs, they realized they were in\nunfamiliar territory. It unnerved them. I explained we were on our way to\nthe village these goblins called home. “Wh-what?! That would be a journey of some two months, normally! We won’t have enough food unless we procure a cart at some nearby town!”\nIt’s a little late to be surprised about that, isn’t it? I wanted to say, but—\nthinking about it—I hadn’t really explained much to them, had I? Things\nlike how we got here and how fast we were going. We weren’t in a hurry\ntoday, so I decided to take the time to explain in detail about what we were\ndoing. Breakfast happened to be served right then. It was just a few wild hares\nroasted whole, but it was more than enough stimulus for the dwarves’\nstomachs to start rumbling. Guess they can keep food down, at least.\n\nAs they ate, I reviewed our future plans. We would be at the village in\nanother two days or so, I explained.\n\n“““No…”””\nThey whispered in unison, realizing exactly how fast those wolves were\ntaking them. “Hey, don’t worry!” I replied. “Once you get used to it, it’s a breeze!”\nIt’d be nice if they could get used to it, but I figured we’d probably\nreach the end of the journey before then. We set off back down the road. Time to build a Thought Communication space for us. Now that I’d\ndone it a few times, it came naturally to me. The dwarves picked up on it,\ntoo, which was a relief. Thought Communication was a sort of high-level version of Telepathy,\nletting you build links and talk with multiple people at once.

I also started noticing that I could control my Sticky Thread to some\nextent via Telepathy. Once you got used to controlling magicules, it was\namazing what you could do with them. Sticky Thread probably wasn’t the\nonly thing I could apply that to, either. These little particles were the\nessence of magic.

You\nreally respected that king, didn’t you?”\n“Oh, that? I did, yes. There isn’t a dwarf alive who doesn’t respect him. Imagine having the hero of your nightly fairy tales serving as your actual\nking!”\nIt was an interesting thing to consider—the mythical heroes of the past,\nstill alive and kicking and protecting their people as king.

I wondered how much he had to sacrifice to maintain that ideal in\nreality. In a way, it was frightening. It took a lot of spirit, I’m sure, to be a leader\nlike that. That was what made people believe in him. …Was I ready for that? I had become, more or less, the master of this\ngoblin village. But what comes after that? “Well, let me ask you this, then, Kaijin. Why did you come with me? Wouldn’t it have been the best thing for your life if you rejoined the king?”\n“Gah-hah-hah-hah! Well! A lot more sensitive than I thought, eh,\nRimuru? I did it because it looked like fun. It was just instinct, you know? Like, ‘Hey, this guy’s gonna go out and do something!’ That’s all the reason\nI needed, y’know?”\n…Yeah. Maybe.\n\nFair enough. He’s right! “Heh,” I retorted. “Well, don’t come crying to me later if it turns sour. I’m pretty well-known for being mean to people!”\nIt was true. I did practically nothing by myself.

One day, something happened to me at the society, which I had visited\nalongside the hero several times.\n\nA man, concerned after seeing how I\njoined her on all of her monster-slaying work, spoke up. “Is that child in the\nmask a girl?” he asked. “Don’t you think she should stay here this time?\n\nThis’ll be a dangerous one.”\nAll I could do was shiver at the idea. At the time, the hero was the only\nperson on the planet I could muster the courage to trust. The hero meant\neverything to me, and I couldn’t bear the thought of being separated from\nher. I was sure the grown-ups would kill me if they found out I was a\nmagic-born. I had that much common sense, at least. The hero gave me a thin smile. “It’ll be all right,” she said in a\nreassuring tone. “Everyone here’s really nice, all right? You’re a strong girl,\ntoo. It’ll be fine.”\nI think that’s what made me do it. I wanted to live up to the hero’s\nexpectations, and I knew this couldn’t go on forever. Something about the\nway she spoke always seemed brimming with confidence, too. It made me\nbelieve whatever she said was true. It was with a strange sense of calm, then, that I separated from her on\nthat day. In the waiting room next to the society’s front desk, I began studying. That was around when I learned that I was in the kingdom of Blumund. There were several other nations nearby, I found out, around the Forest of\nJura. And that wasn’t all. When they weren’t handling society issues, the\nworkers there taught me arithmetic, as well as several different writing\nsystems. I listened intently to the passing adventurers as they spoke about the\nneighboring nations.

I was lucky enough to build friendships with them, and they, in\nturn, taught me about the mysteries of the world. There was much about what they said that seemed unfathomable me. But what I needed most of all was to learn how to deal with elemental\nspirits. Ifrit, a high-level elemental, was merged with me. Apparently, this\nallowed me to harness his abilities without the formality of forging a pact\nwith him. But remember—I still had my Mask of Magic Resistance on. Carefully, I attempted to find an inroad to Ifrit.\n\nSoon I discovered ways\nto manipulate his skills without exacting a burden upon my own body. Somewhere along the line, I came to be known as the “Conqueror of\nFlames.” I was an elementalist, gifted in the arts of fire and explosive\nmagic, and I had grown to the point that no one worried about me joining\nthe hero on adventures. In fact, she had fully accepted me now—not as a\ntraveling companion, but as a full-fledged partner.\n\nIt made me so happy. I had worked hard for so long to help her out, to\nhave the woman who’d saved my life recognize me for who I was. All the\neffort had paid off. Life was good. Several years later, though, the hero went off on a journey. Without me. I didn’t know why. The hero must have had her motivations, much like I\nhad mine. I intended to set off myself someday, so I had no right to\ncomplain about it. Did she want to slay the demon lord I served? No, the truth was…\nShe had saved me, then left me. I needed to find out why, perhaps, and I\nwanted her to accept me once more. I wanted to show that I was alive, that I\nwas human. It was exactly that kind of selfish hope that proved I had no\nright to stop her in her tracks. I was already grown up, not some child naive in the ways of the world.

Whether it was Ifrit’s influence on me or not, my body had stopped\ngrowing at the age of sixteen or seventeen. One of the demon lord’s curses,\nI thought, but it nonetheless served me well on the road. A large number of adventurers were in the business of handling other\npeople’s dirty work—searching for rare plants in the forest, slaying\nmonsters and harvesting them for useful materials, and so on. It was a line\nof work that stereotypically involved huge, lumbering frames and equally\nbulging muscles. Sheer strength bred respect and trust from others, since it\nmeant one could hold one’s own in a job that flirted with the line between\nlife and death. The Society of Adventurers attracted the kind of people who lived free\nlives and were never tied down by any one nation. If they were injured\nfighting a monster, they could expect no assistance from one government or\nanother. Nations already had their armies of knights to protect them. They\ndidn’t need the aid of some dirty adventurer. Sometimes a local lord would ask for their help rooting a monster out\nfrom their lands or villages, but there was no formal system in place for\nencouraging cooperation between nations and adventurers. It meant that\nnations could expand only into the range their armies could physically\ndefend—small pockets of civilization in an otherwise wild land. There would be times when towns fell under attack from powerful\nmonsters.\n\nThree-headed snakes, winged lions, and such. Whenever these\nso-called calamities appeared near a settlement, they would cause as much\nconsternation as a full-scale war. Of course, one might expect governments to cooperate and create\nsupport systems that extended beyond national borders. And such\nagreements did exist, but such support always came after things were stable. In the meantime, it was seen as a country’s own responsibility to defeat the\nmonster in question. This was why those with full rights as city-dwellers were granted special\ntreatment, while the others had to make do with life in neighborhoods built\nin the hazardous areas around the walls. Such people eventually acclimated\nto a life of being pillaged and exploited. The stronger among them saw an\nadventurer’s career as a way to protect themselves.

The wealth gap quickly grew between rich and poor. It was a dog-eat-\n\ndog world, one where the weak had no recourse. I wanted to protect them.\n\nJust like the hero, who’d offered me the salvation I’d so deeply hoped for. If\nI abandoned them, I would be no different from my demon lord. So I worked as hard as I could to be an ally to the weak. And somewhere\nalong the line, people started relying on me. Calling me a hero. A dragon attacked the town, with enough force to equal an entire army. A\ncalamity-level foe, absolutely. Blumund immediately declared a state of\nemergency and placed the nation on high alert. I was one of the many\npeople they enlisted. A calamity-class monster was usually discovered once every several\nyears, but this one was different. No halfhearted strike would ever faze a\ndragon, and the nation’s knight corps was too offensively weak to provide\nany support at all. I myself provided all the offense I could for the effort,\nbut my sword could do little against such a foe, and I was hardly much of a\nthreat.\n\nIf something wasn’t done, it would ultimately lead to thousands of\ndeaths. So I decided to call upon Ifrit, sleeping within my body this whole\ntime. The dragon’s stone-melting breath enveloped my body—but because I’d\nmerged with Ifrit, it felt like nothing more than a passing breeze. By the\ntime it realized I was impervious to its breath—that I was a force to be\nfeared—it was already too late. Waves of white-hot flame whipped out of\nmy hands, binding the dragon before it could flee. In another few moments,\nit was burned alive. I, on the other hand, was left in a coma for a week afterward. The effort\nhad sapped my magical force. I was aging now, and I couldn’t focus my\nspirit as well as I could in earlier years. As my spirit flagged, so did my\nmagic. Ifrit, and my relationship with him, gave me more than enough\nmagical energy to work with, but the vitality I needed to harness it was\ndying on me. I had failed to notice it draining, thanks to my body’s lack of\naging. I’d had Ifrit held down that whole time—no wonder I’d been using\nup so much of it.

If I let myself grow any\nweaker, Ifrit could go berserk on me. Retirement was something I had to\nconsider, sooner or later. I talked the matter over with Heinz, one of the managers who ran things\naround the Society of Adventurers. “If that’s what it is,” he said, “I’d advise\nyou to travel to the kingdom of Englesia. They’re looking for teachers in\nbasic battle techniques over there. There’s lots of ex-adventurers out there,\nbut if you can teach your skills to people, you’ll never be hurting for a job.”\nHe handed me a reference letter I could use. “Thank you,” I replied.\n\n“You’ve done so much for me.”\n“Ah, forget about it,” he protested. “We’re the ones who should be\nthanking you, Shizu!

Back at the goblin village. It had been only about two\nweeks, but I was seriously starting to miss it a little. Assuming you wanted\nto call it a village at all. It was more of an empty space with a fence around\nit. While we were gone, a few simple tents had been pitched around the\narea. There were signs of progress, at least. I spotted a large iron pot\nsituated over the remains of the central campfire. Goblin cuisine used to be\nall about spit-roasting—but now they’d added simmering to the mix! This was a truly remarkable development.\n\nWhere’d they get that thing? Taking a closer look, I realized it was fashioned from the shell of a big\nturtle. Man, how much did they expand their hunting grounds while I was\ngone?\n\nI was glad they’d kept their home base safe, at least. The resident hobgoblins spotted our returning party quickly, greeting us\nwith cheers and applause. I had rudely forgotten to bring souvenirs, but\ngiven the monster pelts and such I spotted drying here and there—proceeds\nfrom their hunting, no doubt—I was sure the dwarves would have everyone\nkitted up and clothed before long. I’d like the goblins to make that stuff\nthemselves later, but let’s take it one step at a time. I tried looking around for Rigurd so I could introduce the dwarves to\nhim. I didn’t need to. He ran right up to me. I thought he was just excited to\nsee us, but he had something bothering him instead. “Welcome back!” he said before I could ask. “I hate to bother you so\nsoon after returning, Sir Rimuru, but we have visitors…”\nVisitors? …But I don’t remember having any friends.\n\nI decided to let the dwarves show themselves around.

Several of them were well dressed, each one\naccompanied by a handful of servants. Some elders and their guards,\nmaybe? Nobody was armed. Not that I minded that. Before I could ask what was up, the goblins prostrated themselves on the\nfloor. “““It is an honor to meet you, O great master!””” they all shouted in\nunison. “““Please, listen to our most earnest of hopes!”””\nGreat master? I guess they mean me, but really, that’s going too far. They sure believed it, though. Their eyes couldn’t have been more longing\nor resolute.

The guards accompanying the goblin elders had gone back to their\nrespective villages to report the news. So what did they have to say?\n\nTo sum up, their story went a bit like this…\nIt all began with the recent disruptions to the order around the forest. The other villages had de facto abandoned Rigurd’s during the direwolf\nattack in part because they simply had no combat resources left to assign to\nthe place. All the intelligent races in this forest—the orcs, the lizardmen, and the\nogres, too—were starting to step up and stake their claims on this wood. There had been smaller arguments along those lines before, but there was\nalso a sort of silent agreement that nobody would let it get to armed\nconflict. With the forest’s one and true overseer out of the picture, however,\nthere were more than a few races out there ready to vent some steam. Monsters, in general, had a tendency to puff up and engage in regular\ndisplays of power. Now every village in the forest was rapidly preparing\nitself to kick some ass. It was only a matter of time before something got\nthe ball rolling. And goblins, the wimpiest kids on the block, were doomed\nto let most of these other races lay total waste to them. This, naturally, alarmed most of the other goblin elders. The moment\nthey got involved in this cross-forest turf war, it’d be over for them. So they\nheld a conference, talked it over for several days, and were all too\nblockheaded to come up with any decent ideas. Not that I would have expected them to…\nNews of the impending direwolf attack came in the midst of this, but\ntheir attention was focused elsewhere. Rigurd’s village was left for dead\nand all but forgotten. Their talks continued, with no miracles in sight. Just as the villages’ food stocks were starting to run low, they heard\n\nword of yet another new forest menace—rumors of massive, dark beasts,\npiloted by people riding on their backs. They sped through the trees, as if\ntraversing flat plains, and they utterly vanquished the more powerful\nmonsters of the forest. Who were they?", "token_len": 591, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

They sped through the trees, as if\ntraversing flat plains, and they utterly vanquished the more powerful\nmonsters of the forest. Who were they?\n\nThe concept made the goblins\ntremble with fear and surprise. They were apparently…ex-goblins. Opinions were split on how to handle this. Some suggested to travel to\nthem immediately and beg for protection. Others found the tale too\nextraordinary to swallow, concerned that it might be a trap and refusing to\nbelieve that the ex-goblins would have no reason to trick them. Trap or not, though, there was no guarantee this new race would accept\nthem. Especially since they’d abandoned Rigurd’s village. Forgiveness\nappeared a futile hope for many of the elders. Even goblins were capable of\nshame, it turned out. In the end, realizing they had reached the far end of their intellect, the\nconference ended with a total lack of any concrete conclusion. So the side\nthat sought our protection decided to travel over here.\n\nNow it all made sense. Still, pretty selfish of them, wasn’t it? We’re\ntalking about weak, stupid, helpless goblins, though, so I should have\nknown better. I’d already agreed to take them in, besides. “Anyone who wants to come over, have at it,” I told the goblin\nrepresentatives. That was enough to send them back home for now. That was where my problems began. As I looked over the teeming crowds of goblins, I thought to myself,\nThis is…kind of too many, isn’t it? Far too many to house within the\nvillage’s space. Why did this have to be my problem, anyway? Over the past few days, we’d been stuck building axes, using them to\nchop down trees for wood, and so on. We hadn’t even started on houses yet. There was just too much to work on. Kaijin was handling wood duties, while the three dwarven brothers\nworked on processing the animal pelts into hobgoblin clothing. The looks\n\nthey had been giving the females were less than savory. I figured it was best\nto set them on that job before anything else. We were in the midst of this when the goblins showed up. Four tribes,\nabout five hundred of ’em in total. The rest were still in the villages with\nthe elders who opted to stay put. Well, time for a move.

I checked my mental map of the area.\n\nPreferably I’d have liked something with nearby water and some cleared\nland suitable for farming. As I walked around, I realized that the most ideal\nlocation was…the area right nearby the cave I’d popped out of. Hmm.\n\nI decided to ask Rigurd about the state of things over there. “It was\nregarded as a forbidden zone,” he reported. “Unlike the forest, it was a\nveritable den of powerful monsters…”\n“No problem there, then. I mean, I lived there.”\n“Y-you what?!”\n“Like, I guess I was born around there, so…it oughta be fine.”\n“…You constantly impress me, Sir Rimuru. I am astounded.”\nFunny thing for him to say. What’s so astounding about being born in a\ncave? If he was cool with it, then fine. I then called for Mildo, youngest of the three brothers, and told him as\nmuch as I could about how architecture worked in the world I came from. Surveying and measurement in this world were actually fairly accurate,\nthanks to magic. That, plus the amateur-hour knowledge I brought to the\ntable, helped us decide to hatch a surveying project for the local area. The wolves didn’t need it much, but for the goblins and dwarves a\nwaste-management facility would be a necessity. I thought it’d be nice if we\ncould set up a pseudo–septic system that could store waste and turn it into\nfertilizer. We’d need something to keep infectious diseases at bay, besides. That was another thing I added to Mildo’s list. Do goblins get sick, though? I wondered. The answer was yes—they\nwere susceptible to disease like anyone else.

So while we were in a building frenzy, I decided we might as well go all\nthe way with hygiene. Mildo, for his part, actually had considerable\nknowledge about waste systems like this. I must not have been the only\notherworlder to talk about this with people. This world, for its part, had something called “spirit engineering,” a\nunique field of study that led to all sorts of weird discoveries. What it didn’t\noffer, however, was a way to make fertilizer out of people’s dumps. Mildo\nwas amazed to hear the idea from me. Regardless, though, after some deliberation, I named him head of\nbuilding operations for our village and left everything up to him. Another classic tossing-off of responsibility, if I do say so myself. After having Rigurd assign a few people to Mildo’s detail, I sent them\nall off to survey our potential new home. Ranga joined them, just in case. I\ndidn’t think monsters would go swarming out of the cave at them, but you\nnever know. Ranga ought to have been able to handle whatever popped up,\nso better safe than sorry. That took care of one issue, but I had something bigger on my plate—\nnaming. Just thinking about it depressed me. I had the sinking feeling that\nby the time I got halfway through the five hundred or so goblins, I’d just be\nrunning through the alphabet. “Abcdef” would be a little hard to pronounce,\nthough. Still, I had to get started. It took around four days to get through them\nall, with a quick bit of sleep mode in between, and I really had to hand it to\nmyself—I stuck it out to the end. Not quite as exhausting as last time, but\nnot a process I wanted to repeat anytime soon. I called the tribal elders over. They knelt down in their stately hobgob\nway. Rigurd was there, and following in his footsteps were three others I\nhad just named: Rugurd, Regurd, and Rogurd. Put all the leaders together, and yep! You’ve got all five vowels! Ranga being the a was a coincidence. So maybe it wasn’t my best, but it was okay!\n\nThey’d never know.", "token_len": 693, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

I’ve always been very good at making that excuse.\n\nThat left one unnamed elder, and she was a woman. Something feminine\nsounding was best, I thought, so I picked Lilina. One advantage of everyone\nbeing hobgobs was that I could actually tell ’em apart by gender. Magic\nSense could help me do that with the regular gobs, but to the naked eye, it\nwas a challenge. Could I turn “Lilina” into another name series, maybe? I thought about it\nbut decided not to worry about the future too much.\n\nNo time for it.\n\nSo here we were. A few hundred hobgobs. Maybe it was time we built a\nclass system for them? With these numbers, I couldn’t tell them “Let’s all\nbe pals and get along” and expect them to follow that. There needed to be a\nclear chain of command, especially given how much monsters valued\nstrength. “All right,” I declared, “I’m giving all of you ranks!”\nRigurd received a nice upgrade to goblin king; the other four elders\nbecame goblin lords. The rest of the goblins in the village immediately\nbowed to them, which was a spine-tingling sight to see. “““Y-yes, our lord!!””” the elders parroted. The ensuing cheers were\ndeafening. I had just inadvertently penned a new chapter in goblin history. Kaijin was kind enough to bring along all the carpentry tools he needed. Garm and Dold were proving to be able commanders on the clothingproduction front. We were building a miniature tower of wood lumber in an\nempty space in the village. Preparations were going along smoothly. By the time I had evolved all the goblins and made sure I hadn’t missed\nanyone, Mildo came back to the village. The surveying work was done\nwithout a hitch.

His competence at his post was unquestioned, and even before then, his\nprowess as an adventurer had brought him all the way to the rank of Aminus.\n\nAnd as he’d promised the Baron of Veryard, he quickly set off to\nconduct an investigation of his own. What his assorted intelligence contacts\ntold him, however, was that the Empire was currently making no moves at\nall. It might stay that way, of course—that was Fuze’s hunch—but there\nwas no room for error. He continued to have his people watch the Empire. It wasn’t his usual\nline of work, but for now, at least, he was willing to make an exception. One day, he received word that another investigation team had made its\nreturn to his city. He went to his chambers and sat down very slowly and\ndeliberately on the sofa in the reception room he always used for classified\nmeetings. Across from him sat three people—two men and a woman, all Branked adventurers. This group, he already knew well. There was Gido, a thief who excelled\nat reconnaissance. Kabal, meanwhile, was a master of defense. Being\nfighter class, he willingly served as a wall for the rest of his party, and he\ndid his job well. He tended to crack jokes a lot, but he was no slouch. Finally, there was Elen, a sorceress whose skill set was geared toward the\nmore unique types of magic.

She had a wide variety of spells at her\ndisposal, but her true skill lay in supernaturally enhanced movement.\n\nIt was\nalso worth noting that her careful planning always did wonders to boost her\nparty’s chance at survival. That was the team Fuze had sent to examine the cave Veldora had once\nbeen sealed in. His first reaction upon seeing them was slight amazement\nthat they were safe. That cave was more suited for people with B-plus ranks\nor higher, and if you took its master into account, tracking down an Aminus traveler or two was usually your safest bet. Even if Fuze himself\nventured in—not that his guild responsibilities would ever let him these\ndays—it would likely be quite a slog if he took it solo. Regardless of their ranks, these were the people Fuze had sent to find\nout what was up with Veldora at the moment. He’d made the decision\nbecause of their uncanny knack for staying alive. The ability to avoid battle\n\nwhile gathering intelligence, in this case, was worth far more to him than\nemploying a B-plus powerhouse. If something had happened to them, though, Fuze would have had to\ntake the heat as guild master. Sending people into areas they were\nunqualified for by rank was a clear violation of guild regulations. A branch\nhead daring to try that would create controversy if the incident became\npublic knowledge. But this was the group Fuze had wanted, and nobody was happier to see\nthem back now than him. “Let’s hear the report,” he said, ever careful not to betray his emotions. No matter how appreciative he was inside, he made it a point not to offer\nthem any reassuring words. The trio was used to this. “It was awful, man!” Kabal blurted. “I so need to take a bath…,” Elen agreed. “Yeah, the hardest part was tryin’ to keep this pair from ripping each\nother apart, I’d say…,” Gido commented. Their debriefings almost always started like this. Their eyes, however,\nwere deadly serious. It probably was indeed awful, Fuze thought. The report began with a description of the monsters they’d found in the\ncave. After bluffing their way past the tempest serpent that served as the\narea’s guardian, they’d proceeded past the sealing door.

The end result: definitely no guardian, or\nleader, to speak of inside.\n\nBut one thing had caught their attention the most. “Here’s the thing, though,” Kabal said. “Once we were done with our\nexamination and went out the door…the tempest serpent was gone.”\n“Right, yeah!” Elen exclaimed. “I couldn’t activate Escape inside the\ndoor, so I spent all that time figuring out how we’d get away from it… I feel\nlike such an idiot!”\n“Yeah,” said Gido. “I brought along an illusion and heat-generating trap,\nand I didn’t even use ’em.\n\nAt least it saved us some time, though. Gettin’\npast it on the way in was one thing, but gettin’ out woulda been another.”\nWhat was the meaning of this? This tempest serpent had a tentative\nrating of A-minus. It was absolutely the strongest presence in the cave. Not\neven Fuze liked his chances much against it. It was the whole reason why\nhe had fretted over this trio’s chances of a successful trip.\n\nSomething had definitely happened over there. Fuze could tell that\nmuch. And he needed to know what.\n\n“All right, guys. I’ll let you rest for three days or so, but after that, I’ll\nneed you back in the forest again. Not inside the cave this time—you’ll be\nexamining the area around it instead. I want you to leave no stone unturned\nout there, all right? Be thorough. That is all.”\n“‘That’s all,’ he says!”\n“Three days? That’s it?! Give us a week, at least!”\n“Yeah, yeah… You know he’s not gonna listen to us, guys.”\nFuze didn’t let the protests bother him.

He had some new information to\nstew over.\n\nWhat could be going on in that forest…? He lost himself in\nthought for a moment…then opened his eyes, only to find three pairs of\nspiteful eyes staring at him. These guys… He sighed, then yelled at them as\nhe always did. “Why are you still here? Get out! Now!”\nThe trio hurriedly excused themselves. Three days later, Kabal, Elen, and Gido were preparing for their forest\ntrip. “That was barely any time off…,” Elen moaned. “You said it, girl,” Gido replied. “Could you stop complaining for a moment, guys?” Kabal, the more-orless leader, admonished with a lack of conviction that indicated his\nagreement. “You’re just depressing me now.”\nThey had few routes into the forest to choose from. The monsters had\nbeen growing incredibly active in recent days, to the point that not even the\nmerchants were willing to send wagons into the forest. Hiring bodyguards\nwas out of the question—they’d lose money on this job if they did. If they\nwanted to visit the forest, it’d have to be on foot for the time being. They\nwould have had to walk at least a little, since the path to the “Sealed Cave”\nwas too treacherous to navigate in a horse cart. As a result, preparation would be key. Procuring several weeks’ worth of\npreserved food was a challenge in itself, but without it, they stood every\nchance of starving to death before they even reached their destination. Elen’s magic, at least, guaranteed them potable water whenever they\nneeded. When they were largely done and it was time to head off, a person\n\napproached them, speaking in a voice that was somewhere between young\nand old, male and female. “Excuse me. If you are headed for the forest, would I be able to join you\nalong the way?”\nThe mask the figure was wearing prevented any guess at the face behind\nit. It was an ornate, beautiful mask, but it bore no expression at all. There\nwas something vaguely unsettling about the whole package, but…\n“Fine by me.”\n“Wh-whoa! I’m the leader here, Elen!

Thus Kabal and his band found themselves with\nanother companion as they ventured into the forest. The sound of chopping trees and hammering echoed throughout the forest. Slowly, the new town and its houses were beginning to take shape.\n\nIn our\nminds, at least. We were still busy laying out the water and septic system,\nso for now, it was still just a clearing. This system took the direction of its flow from the river we were\nadjacent to. We planned to have a water-processing building eventually,\nalthough it was still under construction. That’d be where the river water was\npurified and distributed to people’s houses. On the septic end of things, we built a large chamber out of wood that\nwe planned to bury in the ground. The wood’s inside surfaces would be\ntreated to improve their resistance to rotting, then reinforced with cement. That was what we were working on now. We’d lucked out and found some\nquicklime-type material off a nearby hill. Meanwhile, another building outside of town would be our wasteprocessing facility, where we planned to make the fertilizer we wanted. In addition to this, I was having the crew build a large temporary\nbuilding, a sort of gymnasium they could sleep in during construction. It\nwas rather slipshod since we had no intention of making it permanent, but it\n\nwould do the job.\n\nOutlining the assorted neighborhood divisions was going along well. The upper-class houses, including the one I’d stay in, would be built near\nthe cave mouth. We’d have a line of homes meant for the tribal elders, with\nthe other residences spread out around them. We were doing this before anything else, so it was easy to lay out the\ntown plan without getting things cluttered and mixed up. It was basically\nbuilt in the shape of a cross, with a wide main street, making it easy for\ntownspeople to work as a group if the need arose. We’d have to be careful\nnot to create long lines of identical roads—that’d make it easy to get lost—\nbut it wasn’t too much of a concern.

No point dwelling on that scenario.\n\nIf we got wrecked, we could always\njust rebuild. It was absolutely a good idea to name all the goblins and upgrade them\ninto hobgoblins, though. It did wonders for their intelligence levels, and\nthey were all astonishingly quick studies. Their strength was upgraded, too. The dwarves described regular goblins as straight-on F-ranked monsters,\nwhile hobgobs hovered between C and D for the most part. They felt more\nlike people than they did before, to be sure. Depending on their weapons\nand armor, not to mention their classes and magical arts, there was a lot of\nroom for growth. On that note, I was seeing substantial variation in the hobgobs’ sizes and\nstrengths. The four goblin lords I’d just named, for one, all seemed more\ntalented in life than the rank and file did. Rigurd the Goblin King,\nmeanwhile…\n“Oh, is that where you were, Sir Rimuru? I was searching for you!”\nWho was this guy? He was practically a muscle-bound freak of nature at\nthis point, huge in frame and almost the size of an ogre. “Hell, larger,\neven!” as Kaijin put it. That must’ve been the result of giving him a class in\naddition to a name, I supposed. I swear, the biology of these monsters was a total mystery to me. I’d\nhave to try assigning a few more titles to see what happened.\n\n“What is it?”\n“I’ve come to report to you, sir. We’ve captured a few suspicious\nindividuals.”\n“Suspicious? A bunch of monsters, or?”\n“No, sir, humans. We did not engage them, as you ordered.”\n“Humans? Why here?”\nWhoa! Sweet!\n\nBetter get on their good sides, fast! If it was those three\nidiots from the dwarven gate, I’d be happy to chop them up and feed them\nto our work crews, but…\n“They were engaged in battle with a group of giant ants, it seems.

I thought I\nwould come to you for advice…”\nHmm.\n\nSome country’s checking out this place? I already knew from the\ndwarves that the Forest of Jura was considered neutral territory, unclaimed\nby any nation. It seemed plausible that this was an expeditionary force,\ntrying to find some new territory to take for its own. This could be trouble,\nbut there was no point fretting over it without hearing them out. I could\nthink about what to do after that. “All right. Take me to them!” I said as I hopped on Rigurd’s shoulder. Ranga being out on patrol made transport around our new town a bit of a\npain. I could walk easily enough, but when I was by myself, my lack of\nheight was an issue. I always resented the feeling of being looked down\nupon whenever I met anyone. Having people kneel to greet me just got in\nthe way of actual work. I had a reputation to uphold, besides, and I didn’t\nwant to be under people all the time. Perhaps I worried about it too much,\nbut I always thought it was better to avoid trouble before it started. That was why I tended to travel around on a lot of shoulders these days. So aboard Rigurd’s shoulders, I made my way to see these adventurers. Who are they? I wondered before a conversation entered my (figurative)\nears. “Wh-whoa! Hey! I wanted that!”\n“That’s just mean, isn’t it? I raised this meat myself!”\n“Sir, I regret to inform you that I am not giving up this food!”\n“Munch, munch.”\nCertainly seemed like some excitement.", "token_len": 478, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

It\nwould seem the ants made off with most of their luggage…and even before\nthen, they had not had a decent meal in some time, so I had some brought to\nthem.”\nHmm. That was kind of the goblin king, to be sure. “Oh, that’s no\nproblem,” I replied. “In fact, good job noticing. Helping out someone in\nneed is a nice thing, you know?”\nI felt it was appropriate enough to praise him. He was gradually\nbecoming more and more of a leader, no longer asking me about every little\nthing that cropped up. A good thing, I thought. “Ha-ha! I will do my best to improve my rule and be less of a burden\nupon you, Sir Rimuru!”\nBut I wish he wouldn’t be so formal with me all the time, I thought as we\napproached a simple tent. The hobgob guarding it opened the flap for us. The moment we stepped in, I felt all eyes upon me. Four adventurers sat\non the ground, their mouths full of assorted meats and vegetables. Their\neyes were wide open as they gawked at me. It was a hilarious sight to see,\nalthough they probably didn’t realize it. Hmm? Have I seen them somewhere before? …Oh, right. They were the\nadventurers I passed by in the cave, although one of them was new to me. I\nwondered how any kind of food got through the mask this figure had on. “Munch, munch…”\nThey sat there for a moment, chewing. They sure were taking their time. Fresh roasted meat…mmm. If only I had a sense of taste. Argh… Does\nanyone have some spare taste buds…? Whoops, got a little distracted there.\n\nI turned my focus to the matter at\nhand. Rigurd walked up to a tall seat on one side and placed me upon it. “My\nguests,” he bellowed as he sat next to me, “I do hope you are comfortable\nhere. Allow me to introduce you to our master, Sir Rimuru!”\nI could hear them swallowing down their food. Then, in unison:\n“““Huh? A slime?!”””\n“Munch, munch.”\nAll of them reacted with shock.

With all the food that\nguy was chewing, the results probably weren’t pretty. Rude jerk. Must’ve been a surprise to hear a slime speak. The other three looked\nequally surprised, but at least they didn’t have their mouths full at the time. So.\n\nWho were these visitors? Good guys, hopefully. “Well, pardon us, I guess. I just didn’t expect we’d be saved by a\nmonster tribe.”\n“Oh! We’re human adventurers, by the way, and this meat is really\ngood! We’ve been running for the past three days, I think, so it’s been hard\nto eat much of anything… Thank you so much!”\n“Yeah, thanks.

We can\ntalk afterward.”\nI sort of wished the hobgobs had called me over after the humans were\ndone stuffing themselves, but they were still lacking in politeness here and\nthere.

I wasn’t expecting every diplomatic effort to go perfectly\nwith these hobgobs. Settling down back in my tent, I began patiently waiting. Rigurd had one\nof his female assistants prepare some tea for us. It looked more palatable\nthan the last beverage I’d tried from them, but I could only guess at the\ntaste. Neat how evolution even affected areas like that. Slowly, we were settling down into a truly cultured society.\n\nSomething\nabout that tea convinced me. After a few more moments, the four adventurers popped in, immediately\ngiving a hearty “Sorry ’bout that!” as they entered. The tent was a little\ncramped with all of them inside. Once their goblin guide was gone, another one brought out some fresh\ntea for the group. There, see? Real service, out of nowhere. They must’ve\npicked it up from the dwarves—I knew they had been spending nights\ndrinking with them, learning about their society and culture. “Ah, good to see you again. My name is Rimuru, and I’m the leader of\nthis little group. What brings you guys over here?”\nI figured it was a valid enough question. They nodded at each other—\nmust’ve expected this—and began to speak. “I am glad to meet you, Rimuru. My name is Kabal, the leader of this\nband…more or less. This is Elen, and that’s Gido over there. We’re\nadventurers, all ranked B—you know what that means, I imagine?”\n“Hi! Elen here!”\n“Gido, sir. A pleasure.”\nSo they were a party. Being ranked B put them in the upper echelons, to\nbe sure, but they would’ve faced a rough time in the cave, no? Maybe they\nwere masters at hiding from monsters or something.\n\nAnd what about the\n\nother one in their ranks? I was sure there were only three of them in the\ncave. “This, meanwhile, is Shizu, a temporary addition to our team for this\nmission.”\n“Shizu. Charmed.”\nIt was hard to tell her gender or age strictly from her voice. But after\nhoning my talents trying to differentiate goblins, I could tell right off—she\nwas a woman.

And, if my hunch was correct, maybe even Japanese?\n\nThat\nwas the impression I had. The way she carried her teacup and the way she knelt just so, tops of her\nfeet flat against the floor. That position, I thought, had to be rare in this\nrealm, and her three companions certainly didn’t bother—the men just sat\ncross-legged on the wolf-pelt rug over the ground, and Elen chose to keep\nher legs to one side instead. Ah, well.\n\nIt wouldn’t be strange to have a culture somewhere on this\nplanet that resembled Japan’s. I’d pursue that train of thought later. Although, it occurred to me—was it me, or were these adventurers being\nway too cavalier with their own safety right now? So far, they seemed to be\nenjoying their stay immensely—eating, drinking, and laughing with each\nother. This was a monster’s den they’d wandered into. They knew that,\nright? Maybe they just had a screw loose, I dunno. …Oops. Got sidetracked. Time to continue the conversation. “You too, thanks. So…”\n………\n……\n…\nThey were exceedingly forthright with their story, apparently not wary\nof my motives in the least. Their guild master had sent them to examine the\narea around the cave and check to see whether anything suspicious had\ntaken place…but this mission was proving to stymie them. “Yeah, that’s the thing!” Kabal continued. “We’re here looking for\n‘suspicious’ things, but what the heck is ‘suspicious’ supposed to mean? We’re clueless here!”\n“Totally!” Elen chimed in. “I wish he could’ve said, like, ‘Look for this\nor that or the other thing’ instead of leaving it so vague!”\n“We might be good scouts and all that, but we can’t do everything,\ny’know?” Gido added.", "token_len": 565, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

I almost felt sorry for the guy. Along the way, this group had run smack into a large, suspiciouslooking boulder with a hole in it. This is it! they must’ve thought, because\nthey drew their swords and stabbed it a little bit…only to wake up an entire\nnest of giant ants. Brother. I didn’t know what to say. It was a miracle they were alive—they’d spent the next three days\nconstantly on the run, losing all their possessions on the way, before making\nit here. I had to hand it to them for managing that, really.\n\n“Well,” I reflected, “I wouldn’t say there’s much ‘suspicious’ going on\naround here, no. The cave, mainly, I guess?”\nElen shook her head. “But we didn’t find anything in there, no. Did you\nknow the story behind that cave? There’s supposed to be this big, evil\ndragon sealed inside, but we spent two weeks running up and down that\ncave, and nothing! Two weeks without a bath, and we got practically\nnothing for it…”\n“Whoa, c’mon!” an unnerved Kabal barked back. “We can’t go around\nrevealing that much to them!”\n“What do you care?” Gido countered. “She’s the one who did it! It don’t\nmatter to me!”\nThe men completely panicked at Elen’s unwitting revelation. I already knew, of course, thanks to my last encounter with them.

Maybe I’d have to get a\nbathhouse built around here.\n\nMoving on. “So what were you looking for in that cave, exactly?”\nIt couldn’t have been treasure, after all. Kabal somberly shook his head in response. “Well, if she’s said that\nmuch, no point hiding it. Like she said, rumor’s been going around that the\ndragon in there’s stopped responding…”\nHmm. Not that I could’ve known, but Veldora’s disappearance must’ve\nput the humans in a tizzy. That vanishing act, despite his being safely sealed\naway, was huge news—I guess this was some crazy powerful dragon after\nall, although to me he’d just seemed like a nice guy who liked to chat\nsometimes. Must’ve been a big deal, though, if people were sending out search\nparties. Was building this town near the cave mouth a mistake?\n\n“We brought along a Reaction Stone, too, because they said the cave\nwas practically bursting at the seams with magicules…but it wasn’t\nanything near what we thought it’d be. I mean, the concentration’s a little\nheavier than your typical cave, but nothing outside what’s normal now. And\nthat is pretty unusual, so at least we’ve got that to go back home with,\nbut…”\n“It’s still packed with strong monsters, though, so I don’t really wanna\ngo back in again if I have the choice,” Elen said. “No treasure to speak of,\neither, and no magic ore. All that monster hacking you gotta do, and there’s\nno payoff for it at all!”\n“Yeah,” Gido added, “you might find some bandit gear if you look a bit,\nbut nothin’ worth goin’ out of your way for.”\nOops. No ore, huh?\n\nWell, what if I told you that there used to be loads of\nit…and I swallowed it all up?

What they didn’t know couldn’t hurt them. We continued talking for a while. They had said too much anyway, as\nKabal put it, so they might as well go all the way. These guys were a lot\nmore good-natured than I gave them credit for at first. And if the cave was no longer a location of interest, maybe we wouldn’t\nbe the center of attention after all. I was considering having the town moved\nas a worst-case scenario, but now I doubted it’d be necessary. No country\nhad any legal right to this land, so it wasn’t as if anyone could force us out. Just in case, I decided to ask whether the guild would have any problems\nwith us building a town here. “It…oughta be fine, right?” Kabal said. “Yeah,” Elen agreed. “It’s not the guild’s problem in the first place. What about the local governments, though?”\n“Ooh, that ain’t for me to say,” was Gido’s opinion. Of course, the guild wouldn’t know what their host nations were\nthinking. Plus, if any of them took action, they’d have to prove their claim\nto the other nearby nations. It wouldn’t be worth it. Then, as I thought over this, I noticed that something was going on with\nShizu, who’d been sitting there listening the whole time. Suddenly, she\nslumped to the floor, unconscious. We all immediately came up to her,\n\ntrying to hold her up, when…\n“Nhh… Nraaaaahhhhhh!!”\nThings progressed quickly after that. Once Shizu’s extended groan ended, the tent was visited by absolute\nsilence. Cracks were now appearing over her mask, mystical force wafting out\nfrom beneath. All of us could tell that something bad was happening. “Summon magic?!” Elen shouted in surprise. “Whoa, for real?\n\nWhere the hell’d that come from? What rank is it?”\n“…Umm, judging by the size of the magic circle, I’d have to guess Bplus or higher.”\n“Well, we can’t just sit here, boss.

Mud Hand!”\n“Urrrrrraaahhh! Knockdown!!”\nFirst, Elen tied her down. Then Kabal landed a full-body blow. Gido\nplayed backup, ready to act the moment trouble appeared. Hmm. For B\nranks, their teamwork was top-notch. Not a single wasted movement. But all Shizu had to do was lift the top of her index finger up a bit, and\nthat was enough to trigger a small explosion around her. So much for my\ntent—which I didn’t mind that much, but what about those three? Were they\nhurt? There was a bit of a shock wave, but I was unscathed. Kabal, who had landed a Knockdown on Shizu after Elen bound her, had\nsadly taken the full brunt of the explosion with his body. It had sent him\nflying. Gido was fine, however, and he’d sensed danger early enough that\nhe’d pushed Elen aside to safety as well. “You all right?”\n“We’re just fine, yeah!”\n“Um, I’m kinda aching all over!” Elen protested. “They better give us\nsome hazard pay for this!”\n\nKabal, for his part, was already on his feet. “Owww… Guys, could you\nworry about your leader at least a little?” He must’ve been made of some\nsturdy stuff. “I knew Shizu was a magic user, but summoning, too…?”\n“What’d she summon, anyway?”\n“No, no,” Gido cut in, “that ain’t even the half of it. As far as I know,\nyou can’t launch magic without a chant during a summoning—”\nBefore he could finish, he stopped, looking at Shizu as if he couldn’t\nbelieve his eyes. He had just hit upon an idea. “Wait… No way… The Conqueror of Flames?”\nShizu was still casting a spell. Her entire body was glowing bright red,\nhovering in the air a little. Her mask remained prominent on her face as her\nlong black hair spilled out of her robe. What’s she trying to do?

Once they’re evacuated, get Ranga here for me!”\n“Yes, Sir Rimuru!”\nThe goblin king sped off. I could tell neither he nor his race could do much against this. It’d be a\nwaste of countless lives. And I didn’t want Ranga as a fighting companion. I’d called for him simply because I’d considered the possibility that this\nwas all an act on the adventurers’ part to divert our attention. Their oddly\nloose lips made a lot more sense to me if they’d never intended to let us live\nfrom the start. That, or they really could have been that stupid, but…\nIf this was an act, they might try to stab me in the back while I was\nstruggling with Shizu. That was what Ranga would be for. Maybe I was\noverthinking things, but you can never be too careful. “Yo, Gido! What’s that Conqueror of Flames thing?”\n“Wasn’t that a hero or something?” Elen chimed in first. “I think she\nwas active around fifty or so years ago?”\nFamous, then? I thought to myself. Then Shizu’s mask fell off her face. Flames shot upward. Up in the sky, three flame salamanders appeared. It was a hell of a way\nfor Shizu to reveal her face to us.\n\nHer black hair fanned outward with the\n\nshock wave, shining brilliantly against the inferno. She had a fleeting,\ntransient beauty to her—but her eyes emitted a wicked shine, and the edges\nof her lips were twisted upward in what seemed to be an expression of utter\njoy at the carnage she had seen. Something about it struck me as completely unnatural, in a way I\ncouldn’t describe very well. Then…\nLaunching unique skill “Deviant.”\nThe voice of the world echoed around us.

No wonder the three of them were in such a panic. Even a single salamander boasted B-plus strength. But… What was the deal\nwith Shizu? To me, it didn’t seem as if she was controlling all this—more\nlike Ifrit was controlling Shizu. There was a shock wave as Shizu—or Ifrit—unleashed a torrent of\nmagic force. …That was weird.\n\nIt wasn’t aimed at anyone, not meant to kill—just a\nlittle show of violence, although there was nothing little about it. It didn’t\nseem like the work of a free mind; the attack looked more as if it was\npreprogrammed by someone. Now there was no doubting it. This wasn’t\nShizu’s will at work. Ifrit was supposed to be hers to handle, but now he\nwas out of control. Whether that theory was right or not didn’t matter right now. The\nproblem was the force behind those attacks. It was beyond lethal. Pale red\n\nshock waves rolled across the landscape, hot enough to instantly burn all\nthe buildings we had under construction. God dammit! We just got started, too! The three adventurers tried using a Magic Barrier to block the attack, I\nguess, but it didn’t even last a single shock wave. They weren’t dead, but\nthey weren’t doing too well, either—conscious, but probably immobile by\nnow. “Guys, don’t move!” I yelled at them. “You’ll wind up getting targeted!”\nThey responded by bunching up together, launching both Magic Barrier\nand Aura Shield.

The magic power Ifrit was releasing—with no\ncasting time at all—was blowing searing-hot wind a good hundred feet in\nevery direction around us. If I didn’t fight these guys—Ifrit and those three\nflame salamanders—we were all going down. What a pain. But it was strange. Even in this predicament, I wasn’t trembling with fear or anything. Maybe it was because I was a monster now. I mean, Veldora and that black\nsnake kinda freaked me out at first, but both wound up being good\nexperiences in the end. “Hey.\n\nWhat’re you trying to do?”\n“…”\nPop! An explosion went off behind me. I was guessing trying to talk this out\nwith Ifrit wasn’t going to work. He just answered my question with another\nwhite-hot strike in my direction.

I probably\nshould’ve been more concerned about the flame titan in front of me, but\n\nthat was the thought that popped up anyway. Our tents and temporary\nouthouses were gone, but that wasn’t any disaster. We had already cut down the surrounding trees to expand the clearing; if\nwe’d been in the forest, there probably would have been a massive wildfire\nby now. There’s a silver lining for you. I was a bit concerned about the\nwood and other supplies we had piled up, but there wasn’t much I could do\nfor it now. This giant had a hell of a lot of nerve, though! With that attitude of his, I\nwas sure he saw me as nothing but an annoying little bug in his way. He\nwas dissing me, and that was more than enough to get on my bad side. Ifrit\nwas my enemy, and I decided now was the time for a counterattack. I had\nmy qualms about Shizu, the person Ifrit was probably feeding off of for all\nthis, but if I didn’t strike, this would never end. Suppressing Ifrit was priority one; I could check up on Shizu later. For\nall I knew, maybe Shizu wasn’t being controlled at all. I shot a Water Blade at Ifrit’s stomach. It evaporated right before\nreaching the flame giant; a spiraling plume of fire cut it off. Hmm.\n\nGuess\nthat won’t work. But I didn’t have time to ponder it, because the\nsalamanders had just reacted to my attack. “Icicle Lance!!”\nElen’s ice magic stabbed its way through one of them. As I took a peek\nat her, she was already fleeing back into her corner of the Magic Barrier. It was a clever attempt. It looked as if the barrier was holding up well\nenough without much concentration on the caster’s part. But it’d take more\nthan an Icicle Lance to shoot down those salamanders. One of them lunged straight toward the adventuring trio. “You all right?!”\n“I can do this!” Elen said. “Risking our lives is nothing new to us!”\n“Oh, come on,” Kabal groaned, “I thought I was the leader!

I went back on the move, and the three\nof them were too busy dealing with the flame salamander to talk. Even one\nwould be a tough opponent for them. Hope they hang on okay. The other two salamanders, meanwhile, had started making their way\ntoward me. Ifrit himself was calmly advancing, too. Now what? Just as the thought occurred to me, Ranga finally arrived. I’d expected to\nhave him keep watch over the adventurers, but no longer. He’d be serving\nas my mount instead. “You called for me, my master!”\nI hopped right on his back. At least I had some speed now. The\nsalamanders were pretty quick up there, but not as quick as Ranga. “I want you to focus on dodging them,” I ordered. “You don’t need to\nattack at all. I’ll take care of that!”\n“Understood!”\nWe had almost a wordless connection with each other. Ranga instantly\nunderstood what I wanted to do. Then we were off. The two salamanders fired off straight jets of Fire Breath at us, like two\nflamethrowers in the sky. It was light work for Ranga to avoid them, rearing\nback and out of range of the heat. The fire looked powerful, and I didn’t\nwant to try my luck. If I’d still been a human, they probably would’ve\nturned me into a black divot on the ground. I’d better take care of those two guys first before tackling Ifrit. So I tried\nout some Water Blades. Unlike the fire giant, the salamanders couldn’t cut\noff the attack before it hit home. I managed to slice off a limb…but,\nridiculously enough, the guy grew it right back again. It must’ve been made\nof fire like everything else.\n\nJust cutting it off wouldn’t accomplish much.

It is possible to release a large amount of water. This will\ncause a steam explosion upon contact with the salamander, but is this all\nright? Yes\nNo\nHuh? A steam…explosion…? What…?\n\nUnderstood. A flame salamander is formed from collected heat energy. Being doused in water will cause it to immediately vaporize, creating steam\nthat envelops the salamander’s body. It will also trigger a high-temperature,\nhighly compressed wave of pressure, creating a series of explosions. —And? Will that beat the salamander? Understood. Pressure times volume equals water released times vapor\nconstant…\nStoppppp! Give it to me in a way I can understand!\n\nUnderstood. It will trigger a large explosion, and it is possible that the\nsalamander will be knocked out without a trace. However, the results will\nlikely turn the local area into a vacant plot of land.

Umm, that’s kind of…”\n“Just do it!”\nThe request gave her some pause, but after a second, she began\nchanting. After another moment, the freeze-magic Icicle Lance was\nlaunched. “Don’t complain about this to me later! Icicle Lance!!”\nAs she shouted out the spell, a pillar of ice shot my way. I could\nprobably capture that magic with my Predator skill. And if I could—\nReport. Launching unique skill “Predator.” Icicle Lance Predation and\nAnalysis successful. Great!\n\nJust as I thought. Really, I half doubted it while it was being explained to me, but this\nPredator had to be some kind of rule-breaking skill. That magic probably\npacked a punch, but Predator absorbed it all, leaving me undamaged, and I\neven learned it to boot. “Hehh?! What happened to my magic?!”\nSorry, Elen. Can’t explain. The Analysis wrapped up in an instant, and now I could cast the spell\njust by thinking about it. No chanting required—that was another nice side\neffect of Predator. “Icicle Lance!”\nOmitting the casting time, I fired some magic off toward the salamander. Then, at that moment, I understood—the theory behind magic, and how it\nall worked. My Water Blades didn’t damage a salamander at all, even if\nthey managed to slice right through the guy, but Elen’s magic did the trick. The reason was surprisingly simple.\n\nCasting magic wasn’t about acting\nupon your surroundings with a phenomenon—it was more like picturing\nsomething, then creating it in real life.\n\nI was, in a way, launching a bolt of energy that had the effect of robbing\nthe target of its heat. That bolt happened to take the form of an energysapping ice pillar, but it wasn’t the ice that made it work. It was the energy\ninside. Thus, it applied damage to a salamander, whose own energy took the\nform of heat and flame. And the multiple ice pillars I’d just launched—too big, really, to be\ncalled “lances”—had just skewered the two flame salamanders. That,\napparently, was all it took to rid them of all their magical force.

Let me help you guys—”\nI figured I would help them out, since I’d had Elen waste a magic bolt\non me—but I was too late. “Ah, crap,” Kabal said, “it’s gonna blow itself up!” As the first line of\ndefense, he launched an Aura Shield, but the salamander’s self-sacrificing\nexplosion was more than enough to blow it away. The three of them were\nall exposed to the intense heat as they soared backward into the air. Flustered, I had Ranga run up to them. They were more badly burned\nthan I’d thought. Conscious, yes, but no longer capable of moving—and\nKabal, up in front, had taken the worst of it. If it hadn’t been for his shield,\nthe relatively defenseless Elen and Gido easily could’ve died. “Dammit… Ranga, protect these guys. Get them somewhere safe!”\n“But…”\nThe order gave him pause for a moment, but he fell silent, perhaps\nsensing the mystical force I was letting off. His wild instincts told him that\nno back talk would be permitted, no doubt. “This is an order!\n\nDo it! They’ve got recovery potions on them, so get\nthem to a safe place and heal them.”\n“As you say. May you fight well!”\n“Don’t worry. Ifrit’s all mine!”\nThat must have convinced Ranga well enough.

Even\nif the multiple Ifrits all launched attacks at the same time, I could easily\ndetermine their fire’s danger level from the temperature and take suitable\naction. I already knew that they weren’t all at the same level. I sincerely doubted that Ifrit could hit me with any kind of effective\nattack.

My breath attacks needed to be launched within that distance of\nIfrit himself, which wasn’t gonna happen. I needed an attack that kept me at\na safe distance while dealing a decisive blow to him. The only thing that\ncame to mind was my new toy, Icicle Lance. “Take this! Icicle Lance!!”\nI launched several icicles’ worth at the Ifrit clones and successfully\nvaporized a few of them. Vaporizing with ice sounds a bit odd, but with the\nclouds of water vapor after the attacks struck home, that was the best way to\ndescribe it. I started getting into this little target-shooting game, knocking\ndown the clones one by one with my lances. But—\nBy the time I thought Oh, crap!\n\nit was already too late. The moment I\nfelt it, I was already surrounded. A wide-range barrier to trap me? One of\nIfrit’s intrinsics? In an instant, there was a magic circle painted on the ground, no\nchanting required to cast it. I forgot I wasn’t the only one who could do\nthat. He had transformed his own body into gas and turned a hundred-yard\nradius into a searing-hot ocean of flame. Probably one of Ifrit’s high-level\nranged attacks, and even worse, the area was brimming with energy from\nthe Ifrit clones I had defeated. “Flare Circle!”\nI heard a voice that I couldn’t quite decipher.

All these memories did was torment me. I didn’t want to remember them\n—\nBut that was the path I walked. If I hadn’t run into the hero, I doubt my soul could ever have been\nsaved… But I was too awkward, too unskilled, to wind up like her. With so\nmany people relying on me, too…\nIt was just that—\nIt had been several years since I’d retired from the adventurer life. I was\na full-fledged teacher, leading the next generation of our trade as I helped\nout the society with its work. The Society of Adventurers, a group that crossed borders and had grown\nbeyond the control of any single government, had built its headquarters in\nthe kingdom of Englesia. I was no longer an adventurer, but if there was\nanything I could do for them, I wanted to help them with it. It had been the\nsociety, after all, that had given me a home of sorts when I had nowhere\nelse to go. There, I had a chance to teach a number of talented students. A young\nman with eyes that beamed with complete purity. A girl, her gaze tinged\nwith hopelessness. More otherworlders, I assumed, just like me. The two of them were exact opposites in so many ways. Yuuki was a\nbright, optimistic boy, while Hinata was insular and reserved, as if she\ncarried all the darkness in the world with her. Bandits had attacked her when she came here. At the time, I had thought\nthat she would warm up and come around as the days passed. The bandits\nmet their fates at the hands of some other assailant, which saved Hinata’s\nlife, but I’m sure the incident must have scarred her. I saw a bit of myself in the girl, after all.\n\nI had an affinity for her. It was\napparently one-sided. “Thank you for everything you’ve taught me,” she said. “There is\nnothing else I can learn from you. I doubt we will meet again.” Then she\nturned around and left.\n\nI thought it might have been best to chase after her, but I couldn’t will\nmyself to leave town. The society was building a new shared-assistance\nprogram with Englesia, a new organizational structure originally proposed\n\nby Yuuki.

It was something I wanted to see\nsucceed, considering how it would define the society’s future direction.\n\nSo in the end, all I could do was see her off. “If you ever get lost,” I\ncalled to her, “I want you to rely on me.”\nAfter agonizing over it, I decided to support Yuuki over Hinata. The girl\nhad walked a similar path to mine, but she was always far more strong\nwilled than I was. I figured that I should believe in her. That her iron will\ncould clear the darkness in her soul and transform her into a great woman. It was no great surprise when I learned, a mere few years later, that she\nhad risen to an important position in the Church. I felt a little proud, a little\nlonely…and just a tad anxious. Hinata isn’t feeling lonesome, is she? Is she doing all right with her life? The questions overwhelmed me, but I figured I had no right to ask them. I once had the chance to grasp her hand, and I had refused it. All I could do was pray for Hinata’s continued safety. Yuuki, on the other hand, was far more dynamic. It was Yuuki who built the current system for the Society of\nAdventurers, now renamed the Free Guild. Thanks to him, the guild was\nable to build a successful cooperative relationship with nations across the\nworld.\n\nHe had forged new treaties with governments, earning the guild\npositions in their topmost of councils. His efforts had made the organization\nmore powerful than ever. I should have expected nothing less. Until then, every nation had been\nfocused solely on protecting its own borders. When the Free Guild began\ntaking on monster-dispatch duties, it lightened the loads of every other\ngovernment in the world. And that wasn’t all. Adventurers—people who\ntraveled the world, never beholden to any single country—were obligated to\nfile reports on their journeys. The Free Guild then collated these reports to\ngain a grasp of how monsters were distributed worldwide. Danger levels\nwere assigned to every region, allowing people to travel in relative peace. The system had one other major effect.

Whenever a monster that normally didn’t appear in a certain region\n\nsuddenly menaced a nearby town, the guild was also obliged to send an\nexpeditionary force to figure out the cause. Getting to the root of it early on\nlet the guild and local governments assemble a dispatch corps far more\nefficiently than before. Having this kind of organization made people’s lives both safer and\nmore comfortable. Mankind found itself expanding its cities, and the overall\npopulation has grown rapidly in recent years. The institution of rankings\nassigned to monsters did much to reduce the number of deaths as well. For someone charged with training new recruits, nothing could have\nmade me happier. Thanks to Yuuki, the Free Guild was now an organization\nthat neither the nations of the world nor its people could do without. Yuuki, for his part, just laughed it off. “I was just imitating what I saw in\nthis video game I played,” he said.\n\n“Though, of course, you can do anything\nyou want in a game. You can have monsters that say, ‘I’m not a bad slime,\nyou know’…or even have them join your party!”\nHe was always a joker like that. Monsters becoming your friends? That\nsort of thing could happen only in your dreams. The world I was born in had almost been razed to the ground by war. Had it recovered to the point where it could create people like him—people\nwho never seemed to have a care in the world? He explained to me that these “video games” were children’s toys that\nlet you experience a full story yourself…so if Japan had recovered enough\nto give children dreams to play with, it must have become a wonderful\nplace. So I listened to Yuuki’s stories, thinking to myself about a home I could\nnever go back to. I continued to serve as a support for Yuuki after that—advising him\nfrom the rear, never appearing in the forefront. The Free Guild continued to\ngrow and became an outfit used by nearly everyone. It embraced a\nphilosophy of rescuing the weak, accessible to everyone equally.

It\nwas getting hard to contain Ifrit’s will. Perhaps I was approaching the end\nof my natural life. I knew my Mask of Magic Resistance was still working\nas well as ever, so the reason seemed obvious. Once I realized that, I concluded that I had best leave town as soon as\npossible. I couldn’t know when Ifrit would finally fall out of control, and I\nhad no idea how my death would affect Ifrit himself. Plus, I wanted to retaliate against my demon lord. Just once, I wanted to\nhave my say with him.\n\nSo I decided to set off on my journey. When I told Yuuki about my plans, he silently nodded, saying nothing\nabout them. Hopefully he was willing to forgive this one final act of\nselfishness. Maybe, I thought to myself, this is how the hero felt, too. I made my way to Blumund.

Remarkably, he reported that Veldora had disappeared. The guild was\nconducting a frantic investigation to find the cause. “I don’t know too many\ndetails,” Heinz told me with a snicker. “They don’t tell an old pensioner like\nme too much. I can tell it’s troubling my son, though.”\nHe must have trusted Fuze well to speak of him like that, I thought. I\nhad gone on several monster-hunting operations together with the boy, and I\nremembered him doing a fine job supporting me. Now he was out of the\nfront lines and following in his father’s managerial footsteps. He must have\ninherited all of Heinz’s natural talent. “Thank you,” I said. “You’ve been very kind to me.”\nI shouldn’t get in their way. After my polite response, I stood up. Was Veldora’s disappearance meant to be some divine message to us? Either way, I was headed for the forest. “You stay safe, too, Shizu! I think there’s an expedition leaving here\ntomorrow, actually,” he muttered, almost to himself. “If you’re hitting the\nforest, you might as well join them for a while.”\nHe didn’t try to stop me. He was always an awkward fellow, and this\nwas how he preferred to show kindness.\n\n“Ah, Heinz, I should have expected nothing less.

I genuinely appreciated joining such kind people for\nmy last journey, though their excessive carelessness did baffle me. There was, to say the least, a lot of trouble along our way through the\nForest of Jura. I was impressed, in a way, that they had attained a ranking of\nB at all. They had the battle technique such a rank implied, but if I had to\nsum up everything about their team in a word, it would be “nonsensical.”\nOur journey continued on nonetheless, right up until they jammed a\nsword into a giant ant nest. I was horrified.\n\nThis happened not a moment\nafter I told them it was a bad idea, too. Never in my life did I imagine they\nwould try something like that. My flames could’ve torched those giant ants instantly, I imagine. But by\nthe time I realized how hard it was to control my power, I had already\nstarted to feel my body deteriorate. It remained physically young thanks to\nIfrit’s presence, but as my power over him dwindled, it rapidly began aging. Or, I suppose I should say it went back to the age it should always have\nbeen. Would Ifrit be released once my body gave in? Or would he crumble and\nfall apart with me? I would have no idea what would happen until it did. That was why I had set off. And why I hesitated to pull out my fire. We were lucky enough to be rescued by a passing patrol, saving us from\nany further trouble. But this patrol was one of the fishiest things I had ever\nseen. Being saved by monsters? Nothing like that had ever happened to me\nbefore. These were hobgoblins riding upon magical wolves.

This was absolutely the kind of “suspicious\nevent” this adventuring trio had been sent out to investigate, I thought. My destination, meanwhile, was the castle of the demon lord Leon. His\ndomain occupied the lands just beyond the forest. I should have chosen that\nmoment to take my leave of their party. But…I don’t know. I suppose I just\nwanted to see, along with these adventurers, what kind of home these\nmonsters had made for themselves. It was a strange place indeed, this town our rescuers lived in. It was no\ndank lair or stinking, filthy den. A “town” was the only way to describe it. The shock I felt was beyond comprehension. This wasn’t some rude\nshelter, some glorified hole in a mountain. It was a proper town, one they\nhad built for themselves from scratch. It was under construction, I should probably add. It had been surveyed\nand laid out, and building materials had been placed in each section, ready\nto be converted into houses. There were no buildings yet; the monsters were\nstill living out of neat rows of tents. But they had even started their work by\nfocusing on the underground infrastructure. I had never heard of anything\nlike it on this planet. It was a bizarre settlement. But it was bursting with energy. The residents, despite being monsters,\ntruly seemed to enjoy working on it. Most of them were hobgoblins, but\nthey seemed to share their lands with the black direwolves. A tad different\nfrom the ones I was familiar with, and I didn’t think it was my imagination. The leader of the hobgoblins spoke very fluently to me. I imagine he\nwas the most intelligent among them. He even prepared food for us.\n\nRemarkably, though, he turned out not to be the leader at all. Instead, he\nwas joined by a slime—one who lay back in his lofty throne, acting as if he\nwere king of the world. It might be odd to say a slime could “lie back” on\nanything, perhaps, but that really was the sense he exuded. This slime was the strangest thing of all—for he, in fact, was the leader\nof all these monsters.

The strange creature somehow made me recall memories of my own\nhometown. My heart felt full. Now I was glad I’d decided to step away\nfrom my intended path. This meeting, I thought, was fate at work. And yet\n—\nThe hours we spent enjoying ourselves came to a sudden halt. My life\nwas about to expire. I had yet to reach my destination—to fulfill my goal—\nbut here it was. Ifrit had been waiting for this moment. I could feel his will taking over\nmine. It’s happening… I’m going to ruin all of this, too…\nIf only, one last time, I could just—\nThe titan manifested himself, all but laughing at my folly.

Still, I wanted to take care of her to the end, this\nfellow otherworlder human. The wounded adventurers all pulled through, thankfully, whining\nincessantly about how it’d take more than hazard pay to atone for getting\nburned half to death. “Hey, what’s the deal with this?” Elen asked. “I don’t see any burn scars\nor anything… Like, my skin’s as soft and shiny as a baby!”\n“Dang,” Kabal added. “I didn’t think I’d be able to move for another\nweek or so, too.”\n“Yeah, count me surprised. That’s some potion he had there!”\nThey were right. That potion had made all of them good as new. “You know, though… This probably means they’ll turn down our\nrequest for hazard pay, doesn’t it?” Elen moaned. “Yep.\n\nNobody’s gonna believe us…,” Kabal replied. “Yeah, I s’pose so.

I wondered if they ever really had a\nthought about anybody besides themselves. They didn’t have anything\nagainst monsters, at least. “You know,” I suggested, “once things calm down a little, maybe I could\ngo visit your town.”\n“Oh, if that’s the case, I could give the guild master a message for you!”\nJust what I wanted to hear. Kabal had made my day. I looked up to\nadventurers, kind of. I didn’t have any sort of ID papers, though, and I\ndidn’t even know whether they’d let monsters join the registry, but…it\ncould be fun. So Kabal promised me that I could just say the name “Rimuru” and the\nguild master would hear about it soon enough. Nice guy. I was in such high\nspirits that I decided to give them a farewell gift—a few pieces of\nequipment, freshly made by the dwarven brothers. They were all test\nmodels, made with materials they had procured themselves, but the quality\nwas respectable. Spider robe:A robe of pure white, woven with spider silk. Scale mail:Heavy armor made from the shell of a lizard. Far\nlighter than appearances indicate. Hardleather armor:\nMade from the skins of local monsters. Magical\nresistance included. I also tossed in some food and ten recovery potions for good measure. “Ooh!\n\nLook at this robe! It’s so light, and I can’t believe how sturdy it\nis!\n\nAnd pretty, too!”\n“Whoa! I’ve always wanted some real scale mail! This… Waaaait a\nsecond, did Master Garm make this?! This’ll be like a family treasure to\nme!”\n“Yeah, are you sure we can have these?

I was confident they’d remember to\npass my name on. They were calling me “boss” with the rest of them, too. The three of them had their qualms about what happened to Shizu, but\nnot enough to keep them from setting off again after three days of rest. They had a report to file and a looming deadline. If anything, three days\nwas a generous amount of time to worry over a woman who’d essentially\nshoehorned herself into their traveling party uninvited. Still, I promised them all that I’d take care of her, and that was enough\nto put their minds at ease. A week passed before Shizu woke up again. “Is this…?\n\nOh. I…apologize.”\nDespite the transformation, she still retained all her memories. “I was dreaming,” she told me.\n\n“Dreaming about the past. The city I\nlived in… A place I can never return to.”\nJapan? “Tell me, slime. What is your name?”\nHmm. Maybe her suddenly elderliness was affecting her memory after\nall. I knew I had introduced myself in her presence. “Rimuru, ma’am,” I\nreplied. Shizu closed her eyes, as if thinking over something. “Could you maybe\ntell me your real name?” she said. She must’ve known all along. I hesitated for a moment. “Hmph,” I offered. “You aren’t long for this world anyway. I’ll tell you. It’s Satoru Mikami.”\nMy real name. A name I figured I wouldn’t be using again. “Ah. From my land, are you…? I had thought you might be. I sensed it\nfrom you.” She fell silent for a moment. “I had heard from my students, as\nwell.

Would you mind listening to\nit?”\n“What kind of request?”\nNothing particularly doable, I was sure. But I did promise to take care of\nher to the end. She deserved to be heard out. “I want you to eat me…”\nUm? What did this old lady just say? “You consumed the curse…that was placed on me, did you not…?\n\nI’m\nso glad to be rid of it…” Her voice grew quiet. “I wish I had the chance—I\ndoubt I could’ve ever done it, but I wish I could’ve had the chance to\nconfront the person who placed it on me, one more time… So I have just\none request for you—would you let me sleep inside you?”\nSomething about her eyes, the resolve that she just couldn’t relinquish,\ngrabbed at me. It seemed so absurd, so cruel…\n“I have to tell you—I have nothing but spite for this world. But I\ncouldn’t bring myself to hate it, still. It’s the same as how I feel toward that\nman… Perhaps I can’t help but think of him when I look around me. That’s\nwhy I… I don’t want to be taken into the earth here. So please… I was\nhoping you could eat me instead…”\nHmm. Well, that’s easy enough. Fulfilling her request would bind me, no doubt, and give me a curse of\nmy own. I would be charged with taking on her despair and hatred. Was there any need to waver on that, though? If I wanted her to see the\nafterlife with her mind at peace—the answer was obvious. “All right.\n\nI’ll be happy to take on your feelings. And what was the\nname of this man…the one who hurt you?”\nAt the question, Shizu opened her eyes, scrunched up her burn-scarred\nface, and shed a few more tears. “Leon Cromwell,” she said. “One of the\nstrongest demon lords.”\nShe looked at me with pleading eyes. “I promise!” I declared. “By my name as Satoru Mikami, or Rimuru\nTempest, or whatever works best for you, I promise I’ll make Leon\nCromwell know everything you feel about him.

It wasn’t there. My should-have-been newly born manhood, that is, which I was\nexpecting to see down below. It wasn’t there! What the hell?

If I never had to eliminate waste from my body, what use would I have for\nthe associated organs? And if I didn’t need to reproduce—I was still fuzzy\non that, but if I didn’t, then why bother with genitals at all? That was just who I was now, was all. It was strangely convincing, even\nas it drove me into a deep sense of mourning. Suddenly, I was taken by an urge to touch the top of my head. I felt soft\nhair up there. It made me breathe a sigh of relief. At least I wasn’t shaped\nlike a space alien! That’s a step forward! And, come to think of it, I was a\ngiant ball of fur in wolf form. I don’t even want to imagine what that’d look\nlike without hair. Nope. That’s a dangerous line of thought. Really, though, I thought I’d keep a cooler head than this.

Looked like it was a success after all. It was completed in an instant,\nonly to reveal—\n—Oh, crap. Bad news. First off, my appearance. The hair was a silvery gray with a light tinge\nof blue to it, topping off a pair of wide-open eyes and a charming, young…\nFeminine? Masculine? The lack of genitals made it fairly irrelevant, but in\nterms of appearance, I looked closer to a girl than a boy. This was probably\nthanks to Shizu; there were no features that I could identify as my own. But it wasn’t a perfect recreation of Shizu’s genes, either. The hair color\nwas one thing, but the golden eyes were quite another. Veldora had gold\neyes, too, which was a common trait among the higher monsters, perhaps. And hang on, didn’t Ranga’s eyes go from a blood red to gold as well? Although they also changed depending on his excitement level. Still, maybe\nthey changed because of my influence on him as his name giver. Either way, nothing about this form was from me.\n\nIn this world, the only\nthing that was truly mine was my soul, it seemed. This was mostly Shizu,\nand man, she must’ve been one darling little girl… My skin was\ntremendously smooth, too, with none of the rubbery bounciness of my slime\nform.

I had to hand it to Shizu. She was blessed with a\nlot of gifts. I wasn’t too hideous when I was young, either, but nobody\nwould ever describe me as beautiful, no matter how much I padded my\nmemories. I really have to thank her, I thought to myself as I wrapped a blanket\naround my body, taking the time to hand one to my doppelgänger. Now I\nreally needed to figure out some clothing. Right. Back to the main topic—the real reason I thought Oh, crap at\nfirst. That all came down to this human form’s abilities. Something I hadn’t considered with this replica of mine before actually\nconjuring it was that my enhanced thought processes allowed me a\ncomplete, real-time link with my copy. It and I were both “me” in a way—\nthere were no appreciable differences between us. If anything, Ifrit’s\nReplication skills couldn’t hold a candle to mine—his copies were clearly\nimitations, but mine wasn’t at all. All right.\n\nAlmost not at all. One big difference was my copy’s capacity\nfor magicules—it held only whatever I cast upon it when creating it,\nalthough I was free to “install” more inside if I wanted to. I had a fair\namount of magic to work with, so depending on the application, I could\nprobably do a lot with it. The other issue was that, while Ifrit could generate\nten or so copies without breaking a sweat, my Replication skills were so\nintricate and detail oriented that a single copy was the best I could manage. Still, I could make a copy of myself with all the same attack and defense\nabilities. Any foe who ran into this skill would think I was cheating. The third and final “oh, crap” reason: the way it seemed so breezily\nnatural to me, taking this form. That was something I noticed when I\nrealized no dark mist had surrounded my body. Take my black wolf form, for instance. I definitely used the mist to create that form, although it made for\nweaker results compared to my slime self. It was hard to notice thanks to the limited movement available to a form\nwithout limbs, but a slime’s cells were powerful things—each one could\nserve as a muscle cell or a brain cell or a nerve cell.

That, I\nfigured, was what made the replication “inferior,” if anything, to the real\nthing. As for this mist-free human transformation? You guessed it—it had the exact same reaction speed as my regular\nslime form. No wonder it felt so natural. Having limbs also improved my\nmobility immensely. Even in child form, it was so much easier to get\naround than as a slime, although it tired me out more quickly. The biggest thing, though, was that the lack of black-mist usage meant\nturning human cost me zero magic. Talk about convenient!\n\nI figured I’d be\ntaking this form for most of my future activity. It was time to try something else. I gave an order to my replica—and it\nwas a totally smooth process, just like moving my own body. Black mist\nwelled around it…and the copy began maturing! A trim figure; long,\nflowing gray hair; and an androgynous sort of appearance. Perfect! I could\nthen mold this figure to look more feminine or masculine—go all macho, or\nobese, or in the prime of my life, or elderly. As I soon discovered, I could transform into all kinds of figures—using\nmagic to cover for anything I didn’t have, just like with monster\ntransformations. That might be a good way to give me some more strength\nas a human. It hurt my reaction times, but the bigger I was, the more\npowerful it’d make me.\n\nSpeed was the most important element of any\nbattle, I knew, but striking a good balance was something I could\nexperiment with in the days to come. And so Satoru Mikami, an average middle-aged man living a perfectly\nunexceptional life, came to enjoy his unexpected reincarnation as a slime. After acquiring the form and the emotions of a certain woman, he also\ngained a mission in his new life. And before long, this single slime named Rimuru would play a central\n\nrole in some of the most tumultuous times this world had ever seen.", "token_len": 652, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

The sky stretched blue across the heavens, a refreshing breeze flowing\nin the air. And the humans advancing on him like always. Today, as lively as ever,\nGobta was under pursuit. “Halt, you! Speed’s about the only thing you’ve got, is it?!”\n“How dare you vandalize our fields again! I’m gonna kill you this\ntime!”\nThe humans, eyes red with rage, were closing in on Gobta. So he sprinted at full speed. It’d be bad for him, probably, if he let\nhimself get caught. He could only imagine it, since he hadn’t been captured\nyet, but none of his friends had ever come back alive from such an\nencounter, so all Gobta could do was imagine the terrifying results. He could’ve just kept his hands off the fields and gardens, of course. But\nGobta and the other goblins didn’t quite grasp the concept of agriculture. All they saw was an open field with lots of fruits and vegetables growing in\nit. It was human territory, and they knew from experience that getting found\nwould lead to a chase, but nothing could overcome their hunger. So Gobta escaped down a narrow trail beaten into the earth by the local\ncreatures, chewing the sweet flesh of a melon the whole way. The trail was\nbarely visible at all, the sort of thing only a small goblin could successfully\nnavigate.\n\nThere would be no entry for the larger humans, who could only\nstop at a distance and lob insults at him instead.

He breathed a sigh of relief at his good thinking. Finding an escape\n\nroute’s a basic move, it is!\n\nhe thought. Upon arriving back at the village, Gobta found a group of the older\ngoblin elders gathered around and discussing something. They were joined\nby a few kobold merchants who were in town. “As I told you, these are too valuable for us to be able to trade\nelsewhere…”\n“But that means this magical equipment will simply go to waste. Are\nyou sure you can offer nothing for them?”\n“If they were somewhat smaller, we would be able to wield them\nourselves, but…”\n“Hmm. I see. Indeed, these are too large for us to handle, either.”\nEavesdropping as he passed by, Gobta figured they were trying to sell\nsome magical something-or-others to the kobolds. Human equipment,\nbarring shortswords and daggers, was too large for goblins. Armor, too, was out of the question. Clothing made out of things like\nhard leather could be taken apart and used in piecemeal fashion, but\nmetallic pieces were too much to work with. None of the goblins had that\nkind of knowledge. Magic items were a big unknown. Even touching them, they feared,\nwould break them and make them worthless. If not even the kobolds wanted\nthem, it was a classic case of pearls before swine. “How about this, then?” one kobold suggested to the goblins as they\nscratched their heads. “If you are willing to travel to the Dwarven\nKingdom, they should be able to take these items from you. They would be\nwilling to accept it as payment for dwarven hardware and the like, and they\nwill gladly deliver your purchases to you as well. It will be a fair distance\nfrom here, mind…but as long as you travel upstream along the river, it is\nimpossible to lose your way.”\nThis led to a clamor among the assembled goblin elders. “The Dwarven\nKingdom?!” one bellowed. “That is an impossible distance! I have only\nheard rumors of that foreign land!”\n“How long would it take to travel to such a distant place?”\n“Yes! And who would embark on the journey?\n\nOur young are our most\nvaluable workers; we cannot afford to spare a single one!”\nNothin’ I need to worry about!

Could I ask a favor?”\nGobta immediately froze. Something told him this favor wouldn’t be\nmuch to his liking. “Look at this knife,” the elder continued. “Don’t you think it’s a\nwonderful piece? If you do this favor for us, I’ll be happy to give it to you!”\nThe gleam of the blade was more than enough to grab Gobta’s attention. “Say what you will, sir! I’ll handle whatever you need!” he blurted,\nimmediately forgetting his earlier sense of foreboding. But perhaps that was\nunavoidable. The silvery gleam on this knife was the product of the magic\nimbued inside. It immediately robbed Gobta of the ability to engage in\ncritical thought. His mouth had moved before his brain did.

Me?!”\n“May we count on you for this?”\nNow the elders surrounded Gobta, identical smiles on their faces. The\nsight of their stern eyes above their upturned lips forced Gobta to nod\nmeekly in response. It was said that the average goblin’s life span was no more than a fifth of\na human’s. Their lineage could be traced back to the ancient fairy-affiliated\nraces, allegedly, but given their current degenerate monster selves, it was a\ntenuous link at best. Even the longest-lived were lucky to see their twentieth\nbirthday, and most racked up only a decade or so before shuffling off. The\nage of three, when goblins were ready for reproductive activity, was seen as\nthe start of their adulthood, with full maturity at age five. They were not very strong creatures, and as a result, their species made\nup the difference through explosive numbers of offspring. Relatively few\nsurvived to adulthood, however, making the cruelty of nature all the more\nobvious. Only about half of all goblin children reached full maturity, and of\nthose, less than half ever saw that fifth birthday.

They could\nspeak words, yes, but this was done strictly to communicate their intentions\n\nto each other and nothing more. There was no concept of gaining\nknowledge and imparting it to the next generation, nor any habit of\nstockpiling resources to improve their living conditions. This was exactly why the goblins saw no use for magical items apart\nfrom selling them in exchange for their daily needs, along with any decent\narmor they could get their grubby paws on. The lack of intelligence among even the elders meant that they truly had\nno idea what a journey to the Dwarven Kingdom would entail. The roundtrip would take several months—a hefty part of a goblin’s life span—and he\nwould have to risk everything he held dear. Yet nobody in the goblin village\nconsidered it to be a terribly important mission. To the elders and other\nmature adults, they were simply taking a rough-sounding assignment and\ngiving it to a child with nothing better to do. They held no ill will toward\nhim—nor, really, the arithmetic skills needed to appreciate the scope of this\nquest.\n\nIt was just how it was. And so, with only a few moments of hesitation, Gobta’s journey to the\nDwarven Kingdom was set in stone. Why is everyone so mean? Gobta whined to himself. He had a valid point. He was a goblin child, still not fully grown, and\nthey were strapping a load the size of a mountain on his back and sending\nhim off on some grand quest. He had heard from the kobolds that it’d be a\ntwo-month walk by itself, but with all this baggage? It was hard even\nputting one foot in front of the other. But no point complaining about it. Gobta started to think. Then he had\nan idea. Why don’t I put all this junk in a box and pull it behind me? This, unfortunately, didn’t work.\n\nThe box refused to move. Gobta\nscratched his head some more. Then he remembered the really big box he\nsaw once, near a human settlement, with a horse pulling it around. Oh yeah, that one had some round things on it, didn’t it…? What he was remembering was a cart, and the “round things” were\nwheels, although he didn’t have the words for them in his vocabulary. So\nGobta foraged around for something that would work in their place. What\n\nhe found was a pair of abandoned circular shields.

This oughta do it!\n\nThings proceeded commendably quickly from there. He took a straight\nclub, then used his shiny new magical knife to whittle it down to size. Then\nhe put a couple of holes in the box with his belongings and ran the stick\nthrough the both of them. He jammed the twin shields onto both ends of this\nmakeshift axle and bound them in place with some handy vines he’d found. A couple extra pieces of wood for handles, and voilà—an instant pullwagon. With a few rags piled on top to keep things from falling off—and a few\nmore from the village to keep warm in the evenings—he was set. The elder\nwas kind enough to provide some food and water, too. So Gobta left the village. Long, sentimental good-byes were never really\nthe goblins’ style anyway. I’m hungry…\nA week later, Gobta was staggering forward in a state of near-total\nexhaustion. The food on his wagon, which he’d sort of assumed would last\nhim the rest of his life, had disappeared by day five. There was still some\nwater left, but not much, probably. The wagon, meanwhile, kept getting stuck on tree roots and such,\nsapping Gobta’s strength. Traversing on foot with his energy running low,\nGobta and his journey were in jeopardy. He had now walked for two days\nwithout any food. As his steps grew increasingly unsteady, Gobta struggled to pull his\nwagon along, but…\nI can’t…\nHe plopped down at the base of a large tree on the side of the path. In an\namazing stroke of luck, the moment he settled down, he spotted a\nmushroom sprouting up from the ground. If he had examined it for a little\nlonger, he probably would have noticed its tremendously poisonous-looking\ncolor, but the hunger was starting to cloud his vision.

He lunged at the mushroom, wolfing it down raw without much of a\n\nsecond thought.\n\nYet again, though, Gobta’s sheer luck saved the day. The particular type\nof mushroom he chose was dangerously poisonous, but only if heat was\napplied to it—grilling, boiling, whatever. The juices of its meat would then\ntransform into a lethal compound, something Gobta had no idea about as he\ninadvertently chose the safest way to enjoy it. Having a full stomach did wonders for Gobta’s spirits. He filled his\nleather skin from a pool of water inside a cavity in the tree, then decided to\ntake a rest, not too interested in traveling any farther that day. His wagon was set to break apart at any moment, but luckily there were\nsome useful vines nearby he used to lash it back together, as well as some\nhandy sap from the tree to fill in the assorted holes and crevices that had\nappeared. The bark from the tree did wonders to patch up the largest breaks\nin the box, too. With that vital work complete, Gobta slept the rest of the night, relieving\nhis fatigue. He woke up the next morning, surprisingly chipper considering\nhow yesterday had gone, and began foraging, picking up some ediblelooking nuts and wild strawberries—and spotting some more of the\nmushrooms from the previous day. “I’ve never seen such a dangerous-looking mushroom!” he exclaimed to\nhimself. “Not even I could eat something like that.” So he left them behind,\npicking a duller-looking mushroom to take along in his pocket. Given all\nthe brightly colored, poisonous-looking mushrooms in the area, he figured\n(in his hazy memory) that this must’ve been the one he’d eaten. Man, was I lucky to find this winner among all the poison ones! So he foraged around a little more before deciding to set off. It was still\nbefore morning, and he didn’t have the foresight to stockpile food a little\nmore before departing—so instead he slowed down, searching for more\nedibles along the way.

The sheer size of the river made Gobta’s eyes widen in surprise. He was\nfamiliar with creeks and the like, and he loved playing in them, but this was\na whole other level of grandness. He had seen nothing like it before. The\nsight was unimaginable, and it was little wonder that it amazed him. “Hyaaahhhh! This is so great!!” he shouted. The sight of the flowing\nwater never got old to him. He sat there the entire day, just watching it go\nby, until night fell. The next morning, fully satisfied at the view he had taken in, Gobta set\noff early. Only when he was about to start walking did he notice an\nimportant issue.\n\n“Huh? They said to follow my left hand once I reached the river,” he\nwhispered, not expecting an answer. “But if I turn around, it’s going in the\nopposite direction…?”\nHe was right. He knew he had put a mark on his left hand so he’d\nremember which one it was when it came time to tackle that important\nissue.

The only problem: It turned out his left hand would point in different\ndirections whenever he moved. Follow his left hand where?\n\nThat was the\nhard part. In the end, he decided to pick up a tree branch he found at the side of the\nriver, let it fall to the ground, and travel the way it pointed. The fact that it\nwound up facing the correct way was another testament to Gobta’s\nastounding luck. He followed the branch’s lead, not doubting it for a\nmoment, and the trip went problem-free from there. Just when the journey was starting to bore him a little with its simplicity,\nGobta saw some shallows in the river up ahead. It was a watering hole for\nthe forest animals nearby, although none of them seemed to be fighting each\nother. They were avoiding confrontation at this spot—a sort of instinctual,\nunwritten law of nature, perhaps. Carnivore and herbivore were here\ntogether, one of the few places in the wild world where you’d ever see it. That rule, however, was reserved for the animal kingdom. Humans and\nmonsters didn’t adhere to it. Neither did Gobta. What’s more, since most\nmonsters that hunted animals tended to be nocturnal, the animals lowered\ntheir guards when it was still light out.\n\nWhat a chance! My first meat in ages! Gobta’s eyes began twinkling as he watched the creatures. Large, slow\nanimals enjoyed the feeling of water on their backs; nimbler predators took\na drink and quickly left the premises. There were even smaller birds and\nhares and such, drinking on the far edges to avoid the others. His eyes swam as he took in all the options. Then he found a wild hare\n—a slower-looking one, fat and juicy to his eyes. The perfect size for\nsomeone like Gobta. Anything larger would’ve been too dangerous.

He grinned to himself, slowly closing in as he gathered a few stones\nfrom the ground. In a moment, he was within what he felt was comfortable\nthrowing range. His stealth skills, honed by a long career of raiding\nvegetable gardens, paid off for him. “Yah!”\nBrimming with confidence, Gobta launched a stone at the hare. His\nunerring aim gave him a clean hit, and the animal fell into the watering\nhole. The others around it immediately darted off. Gobta didn’t care. He\nwas already salivating by the time he picked up the body. Then, a problem occurred. “Grooooooooar!!”\nWith a mighty wail, a magical beast appeared from between the trees. It\nwas standing majestically atop a small cliff, and slowly its eyes turned\ntoward Gobta. This was a blade tiger, the so-called king of this dense forest. It enjoyed\na rank of B, pretty well ensuring that an F-ranked goblin stood no chance. This beast was here for the animals around the watering hole, just like\nGobta was—but thanks to Gobta taking action first, all the animals had\nscattered, leaving the blade tiger with nothing. Nothing, that is, except\nGobta himself. And his catch, of course, but that wouldn’t be nearly enough\nto sate this monster.\n\n“Gehh! Are you after me?!”\nThe blade tiger leaped from its perch, unfazed by the height of the cliff,\nand landed in front of Gobta without a sound. It made him flinch, but his\ninstincts told him that running was pointless.\n\nAs it was, there was no escaping a fate that ended in the tiger’s maw. What should he do?\n\nGobta thought as hard as he could. Then…\nIf this is how it is, I’ll have to struggle as much as I can! Steeling himself, Gobta readied himself against the blade tiger. There\nweren’t many options at his disposal. His left hand still had a stone in it, but\nagainst a blade tiger, that wouldn’t accomplish much.

Once he made that conclusion, there was no time to\nwaste.\n\nThere was nothing else at his disposal, so he decided to believe in his\nchances and keep resisting until the end. First, Gobta lobbed the stone. The knife was his real ticket out of here,\nbut if the tiger dodged it, he was dead. So he used the stone first to distract\nthe beast. The blade tiger easily leaped out of its way, and Gobta,\nanticipating where his adversary would land, removed the knife from his\npocket and prepared to hurl it toward—\nUm, this is a mushroom…? It took a few moments for him to realize that it was no knife he was\nabout to throw at the blade tiger. But he was already in motion, unable to\nstop, and away the mushroom went. He was kind of planning to eat that\nlater. The one dull-colored mushroom he could find in a grove full of\npoisonous ones. He’d meant it for a snack and then promptly forgotten\nabout it. But then something beyond Gobta’s imagination took place. It turned\nout that this mushroom was a rare poisonous type, one containing spores\nthat were loaded with lethal venom. Gobta had been walking around with\nthat in his pocket the whole time, and then he’d thrown it at a magical beast. The blade tiger glanced at the mushroom hurtling toward its face, then\nopened its mouth. It used its Voice Cannon skill in an attempt to vaporize it\n—which proved to be a mistake. The pulverized mushroom immediately\nreleased all its spores, which floated on the breeze and landed all over the\ntiger’s body. It fell to the ground, twitching, racked from head to toe with\npain; the spores had entered its eyes, ears, and mouth and were relentlessly\npunishing its senses. For the first time since birth, the blade tiger was experiencing a truly\n\nindescribable level of pain. Gobta wasn’t very smart, but he was smart\nenough to take advantage of the situation.

He kept going as long as his breath\nwould let him, until he finally made it to what seemed to be a safe place. He breathed a sigh of relief, having escaped what had been the greatest\ndanger ever to occur in his life. Being freed from certain death immediately reminded Gobta that he was\nhungry. He recalled the hare in his possession, but not even he was simple\nenough to let his guard down here. He decided to move over to the riverbed,\nwhich would give him a good view of his entire surroundings, and used\nsome stones and dead sticks to fashion a serviceable outdoor stove. The danger of the past few moments was now firmly behind him as\nGobta’s thoughts turned to his appetite. He drained the carcass of blood,\nbristling with anticipation, and skinned and gutted the animal. Before long, it was arranged on a stick atop the fire. Now all he had to\ndo was rotate the stick around and make sure the surface was fully cooked. It was a simple recipe, combined with some berry juice squeezed over the\ncarcass, and it took only a few moments to wrap up. “This is great! This is so great!”\nGobta chewed on the meat, not minding the oils dripping down on him. There was nothing more delicious than the first meal after staring death in\nthe face. In Gobta’s case, after living off wild strawberries and assorted nuts\nfor the past X number of days, the first meat he could remember tasted as\nthough he had ascended to heaven. Nothing could have made him happier.\n\nAs far as he was concerned, the fear he’d felt before the blade tiger was\nall in the past. His brain had already processed it as just another incident in\nhis life. It was the first time Gobta had gotten to eat his fill in a while. This\nhe did, with gusto. “Right!” he said. “I have a feeling tomorrow’s gonna be a great day!”\nTo Gobta, the past might as well have been a faraway oblivion. All that\nreally mattered was the next day.", "token_len": 696, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

All that\nreally mattered was the next day.\n\nThe blade tiger run-in turned out to be the last major trouble Gobta\nencountered for the next month of traveling. The hazy mountains that had seemed so far away long ago now loomed\nso large that the peaks were no longer visible, even if he looked straight up. The buttes above him had been weathered down by the rain to form a\nbeautiful, powerful-looking, sheer wall. Everything was a new sight to\nGobta, and everything grabbed his interest. But he didn’t have the time to leisurely take in the sights.\n\nHe was almost\nout of food again. He was already in lands more or less under the protection\nof the dwarven king, mostly grasslands outside the Forest of Jura. He tried\nto collect as much as he could before he took up the mountain road, but not\nonly would there be no replenishing his stockpiles—those stockpiles were\nstarting to look pretty meager. The breathtaking views around him helped Gobta forget about his\nhunger, but it was now time to face reality. And that wasn’t the only\nproblem.\n\nGobta wasn’t the only one on the road to the Dwarven Kingdom. As a neutral trade hub, it played host to all kinds of different species—not\njust magic-born creatures and people but also humans. As Gobta discovered, most travelers along this route preferred to stick to\nlarge groups if at all possible. All races were guaranteed safety in the\nkingdom, as a rule, but security forces could reach only so far in the\nborderlands. People needed to and were expected to fend for themselves. That was common sense to the merchants, but Gobta neither knew nor\ncared about any of that. This was why, while he was distracted over the food issue, he ran into a\nwholly different kind of problem. Just as he was thinking about how he’d\nbetter find some real nourishment soon, he heard a voice. “Yo,” it said, “what’s a lone goblin doin’ here cartin’ valuables around,\neh?”\nGobta didn’t understand him. Goblins communicated with each other\nusing a method not terribly far from the Thought Communication skill. A\nfew broken words of human speech were the best they could handle. He was, however, still sensitive to the malice behind the statement. He\nhadn’t noticed the human’s approach, and looking up at him, Gobta could\nalready sense the danger.", "token_len": 684, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

Gobta grabbed at the handles on his wagon, preparing to run away at full\nspeed. But…\n“Ohhh no you don’t!”\nAnother human appeared in front of him—a fighter in metallic armor. The other man, wearing lighter gear, peered inside the wagon and let out an\nappreciative whistle. “Whoa!\n\nI wasn’t expecting much, but these’re magic items, aren’t they? Boy, are we lucky today! All we gotta do is kill this little guy, and we’ve\nalready earned the money for our shopping trip!”\n“Oh? I was expecting just a little spending cash, but what a stroke of\nluck. Can’t wait to see the faces on those bastards who were too lazy to join\nus!”\nGobta ignored the exchange as he thought about what to do next.

What should I do?!\n\nIf this keeps up, they’ll take all of it. And I think my\nlife might be in danger, too…\nAs he thought about it, it was clear these men might be after more than\nsome magic doodads. Only then did Gobta realize the extent of the danger. Soon he realized he was right. Blocking his path of retreat, the men\nbegan attacking him. Considering Gobta’s childlike size, it wasn’t a fair\nfight. The men were fully armored and boasting the strength of rank-D\nadventurers. Gobta didn’t stand a chance. Without a stroke of luck\nequivalent to the one that helped him survive the blade tiger, it would be the\nend of the road for him. But once again, the goddess of fortune smiled. “What are you people doing over there?”\nGobta and his attackers turned around to find a goblina staring them\ndown—a fighter, judging by her muddy red hair. They could see a kobold\nmerchant caravan behind her—she must have been a bodyguard. The men took a moment to size up their chances. They numbered two,\nand they’d potentially be taking on an entire caravan led by a professional\nwarrior. Hobgoblins of either gender were high-level creatures capable of\nlanguage, far more intelligent than their goblin relatives. In terms of skill,\nmeanwhile, the men were still rank amateurs.\n\nThis was no match a sane man would take. And even if they just wanted\nto make off with this doltish goblin’s baggage, it was too late for that. “Pfft,” the armored one said. “We’ll let you go this time!”\n“Best be glad to still be breathing, worm!”\nAnd then they left, leaving Gobta miraculously alive yet again. Gobta must have been so elated at this stroke of fortune that he lost\nconsciousness, because the next thing he knew, the clattering of the horse\nwagon had started to rouse him. The bruises the men had landed on him\nstung enough to wake him up fully. “Oh, are you up?”\nHe looked up to find the red-haired goblina at his side—almost human\nin appearance, unlike the apish goblins. A single glance made Gobta her\nprisoner. He instantly forgot all about his injuries and immediately fell in\nlove with the woman. “An angel.

I want you to birth\nmy children!”\nWhen it came to romance, goblins never took things slow. The rest of\nthe wagon’s occupants took it as a joke. “Bah-hah-hah-hah! Nice one, kid!”\n“Oh-ho! You heard him!”\n“Silence, you two!” the goblina snapped. “Stop with the chitchat and\nstay on alert!”\nThe sarcasm flew straight over the head of Gobta, his burning eyes still\nfixated upon his new ideal. Reality, unfortunately, was not as kind. “Look,” the woman said, “cowards like you just aren’t my type. Letting\nyourself be bullied by humans that weak? I’d never let a man like that into\nmy life! I’d at least like someone who could rescue me, if need be.”\nThus Gobta’s first romance ended several seconds after it began. The\nphysical pain returned.\n\n“N-no… I can’t believe it…”\nThen he fainted again, the sense of loss too much to bear. The kobold caravan wound up taking him all the way to the Dwarven\nKingdom, at least, which saved him the trouble of being killed by roadside\n\nscavengers at night…\nHis first love didn’t quite work out, but at least his first quest did. Thanks to his newfound kobold connections, Gobta was quickly taken to\na dwarven shop willing to purchase his luggage. The employees were a bit\nsurprised to find magical weapons underneath the stained rags covering his\nwagon, but the rest of the transaction was handled with trademark dwarven\ncustomer service. The dwarves here were so accustomed to dealing with monsters that\nthey could even communicate with them to some extent.

No wonder he had plucked out a mushroom instead. “No, this is mine,” Gobta replied. “Not selling.”\nThe dwarf nodded. “It’s a good piece,” he said, “but its magical force\nhas almost run out. It’d only work one or more two times, I imagine. Do\nyou know how to use it?”\n“No, but…is this a magic weapon?”\n“It is. It’s called a Flame Knife. It’s made of silver, but it’s been imbued\nwith magical force. It was originally made as self-protection for human\nnobles. I could teach you the incantation if you like, but don’t expect it to\nlast long when you use it.”\n“Really?!”\n“Really.\n\nJust take good care of it. It’s a dagger of Dwarven Kingdom\nmake, after all!”\nSo the good-natured dwarf gave Gobta the correct spell to use,\napparently deciding that the idea of a goblin with magic dwarven weapons\nwas amusing enough to warrant giving some help. Gobta’s business here was now over. He had accepted items instead of\nmoney for his load, but there’d be no need to cart it all back—the cost of\nshipping was factored into the deal the dwarves gave him.

He brought it all to the transfer station for registration and shipment.\n\nThey gave him a magic-infused tube that, once he placed it where he\nwanted it, would transmit his items right to that point. It would work only\nonce, of course. Inexpensive purchases like Gobta’s could also be sent by\nHeavenly Transport, but that was available only for short distances, and\nbesides, Gobta didn’t have the language to express exactly where he lived. For him, even though it added to the price, magical transfer was the only\noption. Gobta didn’t hesitate to take the offer, not exactly champing at the bit to\npull a full wagon all the way back home as well. It’d save him from more\npotential raiders and unburden him to boot. The decision would prove to be\nthe correct one later on. After he was done at the transfer station, Gobta returned to the seller\nfrom before, hoping to express his thanks to the dwarf who had referred\nhim. “Hello!” he said. “They’re going to transfer my purchases for me. Thanks!”\n“Oh, you again? Well, wonderful.\n\nOh, and you can have this back. We\ncan’t sell this piece.”\nThe dwarf gave him a thick coat made of the animal pelts Gobta had\nbeen using as a blanket. He had taken several more wild hares, saving their\nskins for later sale; the coat was made from all of them, offering the wearer\nshelter from the cold.

His\n\nmission was complete, but he wasn’t about to set off that quickly.\n\n“I’ve\nmade it this far,” he whispered to himself. “It’s all right if I see the sights a\nlittle, right?”\nThe Dwarven Kingdom was built inside a large, natural cave, preventing\nGobta from seeing the sun directly. Thanks to some clever engineering that\nallowed natural sunlight to enter the city’s living spaces, however, it was\nmore than bright enough to see by. At night, the fluorescent moss that\ncovered the cave’s walls provided about as much light as a full moon. One issue was how people handled fire. The kingdom wasn’t an\nenclosed space, but the cave made it easy for clouds of thick smoke to form,\nmaking ventilation a priority. As a result, whether indoors or “outdoors,”\nthe use of fire was restricted, with firemen required to be on hand at all\ntimes near workshops, kitchens, and any other workplace that handled\nflame. Which meant that cooking food was allowed only in certain places,\nalways indoors. Usually, if he was uncomfortable, he could just douse himself in some\nwater. But Gobta had just wrapped up a long journey. To be blunt, he was\nrank. It was to be expected, given goblins’ lack of regular bathing habits. He didn’t stand out too much in the shops near the entrance, which were\npacked with freshly arrived adventurers just as smelly as he was, but things\nwere different in the lodging quarters. There was ventilation, yes, but\nGobta’s natural smell was more than enough to alarm the people around\nhim. In the merchant areas, passersby and visiting merchants visibly crinkled\ntheir noses. It was enough to make even Gobta feel socially awkward. I don’t really like it here… Maybe I should leave sooner rather than\nlater. Feeling ashamed, Gobta decided to head home. That was the right decision to make. For one thing, he had no money\nand no way of eating while he toured the city.

There was no way around it.\n\nSo Gobta decided to wrap up his little tourist jaunt and get back on the\nroad—and then he saw it. A store festooned with beautiful, eye-catching\ndecor, filled with goddess-like women chatting with each other. The goblina\nbodyguard from the caravan had seemed divine to him before, but these\n\nwomen were different. They had long, flowing blond hair, their long ears\npoking out from below. They were elves, particularly fairylike members of\nthe sprite races. Concepts like beauty and ugliness would normally be dependent on the\nrace or species one belonged to. There were no absolutes. However, when it\ncame to goblins, their likes and dislikes were closer to people’s than not. It\nwas a relic from their fairy heritage, and while their looks had retrogressed\nmore than a little over the years, they were still magical in nature. It was to\nthe point that some particularly senseless goblins would even attack people\nwith procreation purposes in mind. So lovely!\n\nI wish I could make friends with a pretty elf girl sometime,\ntoo! Gobta wanted it to happen. And he knew that getting stronger was the\nonly way to do it. Just as that caravan guard had said, if he was stronger,\nbeautiful women would like him—that was how his thought process\nworked. It was with that new goal in life that Gobta spent his single night in the\nDwarven Kingdom. It seemed foolish to depart for the wilds at night, so he\ncamped out in the park near the main gate instead. The cave at least\nprevented him from getting rained on, and the coat that nice dwarf had\nmade for him kept the cold at bay. It was a more comfortable night than\nhe’d expected, and Gobta awoke bursting with energy. The fountain in the park apparently used spring water as its source,\nallowing passersby to drink from it. Gobta took his skin out from the\nbackpack, filled it up, and set off, leaving the Dwarven Kingdom behind\nhim. Someone spoke to him right after he passed through the gate. “Oh, is that you, kid? Is your work done here?”\nGobta looked up to find a kobold merchant. Two hobgoblin fighters\nwere behind him, along with the goblina with the muddy red hair. “Oh, it’s you!” Gobta exclaimed.", "token_len": 679, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

Richer merchants would\nspend several nights in the city, enjoying the assorted entertainment options\n\nit offered, but the smaller-time caravans didn’t have that luxury. Get in, do\nyour business, get home, and relax with your own kind—that was how they\nnormally worked. The kobolds invited Gobta onto their caravan after greeting him. “We’re taking the same route, aren’t we? We have room, so why not join\nus? Just provide us some protection if any bandits or magic beasts show\nup,” their leader said with a grin. He was expecting nothing from Gobta, of\ncourse—this was just a polite excuse to get him on the wagon. Gobta,\ncompletely insensitive to sarcasm, laughed with him, a little proud to be\noffered such a role. The group proceeded along the river path, blessed with an uneventful\njourney as they pressed through the grasslands and plunged into the Forest\nof Jura. Gobta had ample wild birds to hunt wherever they rested, a decent\nsupply of nuts and fruit to gather—and he did his part, pooling his resources\nwith the caravan’s. “You’ve got a real talent for this, don’t you?” the leader said, a tad\nastonished. “Look at all the food you’ve tracked down for us…”\n“Indeed,” another kobold interjected, “you must know the Forest of Jura\nlike the back of your hand. In the woods, you’re a lot more help than I’d\never expect.”\n“Quite true. I had no idea you had this kind of talent!”\nGobta, his latest catch in one hand and a spare stone in the other,\ncouldn’t hide his joy at this. Nobody ever praised him this much in the\nvillage.

Even Gobta, who was rapidly letting all the praise get to his\nhead, was a little iffy about trying it. “Um, those plain ones?\n\nYou can’t eat those,” the goblina told him. “Those are known as firespores, and they’re deadly.

In addition to the group he was in, there were others by\nthe river, replenishing their water supply, as well as cooking the food they’d\nfound. Just as they all had finished their jobs and were about ready to prepare\ndinner—\n“Groooooar!!”\n—they heard a terrifying, earth-shattering roar. A magical beast\nappeared, exuding rage as it eyed the caravan. It was that blade tiger again,\nthe B-ranked beast that Gobta had inadvertently defeated a few months\nback. The poison spores had damaged it, but it had been lucky enough to be\nnear a lake that must have helped it recover. It was still as angry as ever,\nthough, more than angry enough to convince the low-ranked goblin that had\nonce escaped it that all was lost now. The beast, proud by nature, had sworn it would avenge the slight upon\nits reputation. With another roar, it used Voice Cannon to cleanly blow one\nof the guards away. The single blast made it all too clear how powerful the\nblade tiger was—even the stoutest of hobgoblins would face grave injuries\nafter taking the brunt of it. If it weren’t for the full-plate armor protecting\nhim, he would have died instantly. “My brother!”\nAnother hobgoblin let out a yelp of surprise, but he was too petrified to\nmove. All he could do was hold an unsteady ax in his hands and keep a\nwatchful eye on the blade tiger. No one could blame him. Hobgoblins were\nranked C or so.\n\nThey weren’t made to take on a tiger like this. “Don’t prod him,” the female guard quietly warned. “This guy’s\ndangerous. It’d take ten of us to have at least a chance of taking on a blade\ntiger. Merchants! We need to give up our goods and slowly step away from\nthe area.”\nShe knew that angering a blade tiger would do nothing but make the\nsituation even more treacherous. She at least wanted her clients to survive\nthe encounter. While the tiger was feasting on their horses, they could at\nleast attempt an escape—if they were lucky, they might even make it.", "token_len": 697, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

While the tiger was feasting on their horses, they could at\nleast attempt an escape—if they were lucky, they might even make it.\n\nBut that hope was quickly dashed. The blade tiger didn’t want a meal. It\nwanted revenge. It eyed the rest of the guards slowly, seeking out the goblin\nit really wanted. Then it snarled at the kobolds slowly edging away from\ntheir encampment. The merchants fell to the ground, understanding they’d\nbe allowed no mercy. “Well, this is it,” one of the guards muttered. “It’s not gonna let us go.”\n“What should we do, miss? We can’t win this?”\n“Guess we gotta charge it. Merchants! Once we’re on our way, I want all\nof you to run like hell! And don’t bunch up, either, unless you want to die.”\nThe guards were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their\nclients, using themselves as bait to let them survive. Despair filled the air\naround them, but one among them failed to read the mood. That was Gobta,\nof course, who took the blade tiger’s roar as nothing less than his big\nchance. It’s that tiger, isn’t it?! The guy I chased off with that mushroom?\n\nEven I\ncould beat him! It would have been a fatal mistake for anyone else, but Gobta was the\nonly one in the camp not completely stricken by terror. He leaped forward\nas the blade tiger let out another sinister snarl. “You fool!” the female bodyguard shouted. “What could you ever do?!”\n“You can leave this to me!” Gobta shouted back with a smile. Then he\ndashed into the forest. The blade tiger immediately gave chase, ignoring\neverybody else. The rest of the group were left dumbfounded, if only for a moment. “That idiot… How could he be so reckless…?”\nThe seemingly selfless move shook the guards to the core, but they\nknew they couldn’t let this chance go unheeded. “Everyone!", "token_len": 582, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

We’re not intending to die here, either. I’d kinda like to see\nyou guys again, all right?”\nWith that, the guards piled the merchants into the wagon.

Now the sight of the blade tiger catching up to him was getting a bit\nunnerving. It deserved every bit of its B rank when it came to speed, and\nsoon it was right on Gobta’s heels. Maybe I shouldn’t have tried to act all cool back there—\nThere was no point regretting it now. Gobta was too busy trying to\nwiden the gap to care. But even as his chances of being cornered grew by\nthe second, another brilliant idea entered his mind. Maybe if I use this—\nGobta stopped, standing his ground, and took something out from his\npocket. With a defiant grin, he threw it straight at the blade tiger. The\ncreature stopped, more surprised at the sudden end to this chase than at the\nobject hurtling toward its head. This would normally be when the blade\ntiger used Voice Cannon, its mightiest weapon, to pulverize whatever was\nin front of it. But the memory of its past errors made the tiger hesitate. It was intelligent enough not to repeat the same mistake twice—but what\nwould normally be an advantageous trait spelled doom for it. Instead of\nVoice Cannon, the blade tiger figured it would bite down on the incoming\nobject to stop it. With its reflexes, it would be an easy thing to do. But the moment the object was between its teeth, Gobta shouted:\n“Unseal!!”\nBefore the blade tiger could understand it, the incantation took effect. Just as Gobta had hoped, the magical tube provided to him by the transfer\noffice did exactly what it was made to do—unfurling all the pots, pans,\nweapons, and even his wagon inside the tiger’s mouth. This had exactly the effect Gobta had been hoping for—it ripped the\nblade tiger’s jaw off its head. “All right!” Gobta shouted in joy. But that wasn’t the end of his plan. He\nstill had one final weapon on hand—his Flame Knife. Considering a blade\ntiger’s performance in battle, merely losing its lower jaw wouldn’t be\nenough to send it down for the count. That was why Gobta figured his pride\nand joy—his one magic weapon—would be what it took. Then Gobta noticed the (slightly bloodied) items strewn on the forest\nfloor.

But if I burn this here, I’m going to burn my stuff, too, aren’t I? Maybe I\n\nshould try to lure him deeper in. Once again faced with an agony it had never known, the confused blade\ntiger was starting to lose its ability to make rational decisions. Gobta’s\nfleeing enraged it. It could no longer consider its adversary’s schemes or\nultimate goals. Instead, it followed instinct and gave chase again. The pain was intense, but it was the humiliating loss of Voice Cannon\nthat made it especially furious. All that filled its mind was a consuming\ndesire to kill Gobta for good. After creating a measure of distance between him and the tiger, the small\ngoblin dove into a dense thicket. This reduced the blade tiger’s advantage\nand further widened the gap between Gobta and his pursuer. Turning around, Gobta focused on the blade tiger.

Just as he’d thought,\nit was making a beeline for him.\n\nOkay!\n\nI can’t miss from here! Caught up in the dense underbrush, the tiger found itself robbed of its\nmobility. A straight throw, Gobta figured, was all he needed to hit home—\nand he had magic to trigger, too. Not even a magical beast would crawl\nhome from that in good shape. With Voice Cannon gone, the blade tiger had nothing to block with. Gobta knew it. So he threw the Flame Knife. “Fire!” he shouted, the word the dwarf had taught him. That activated\nthe knife. Flames encompassed it as it zoomed toward the blade tiger. A\nmagic weapon like this would normally be nothing to a B-ranked magical\nbeast, but the tiger was on its guard. Fatally so, as it came to be. Using one of the bladelike fangs on its upper jaw, the blade tiger\ndeflected the flame-infused knife. Gobta gasped in despair…but that was\nexactly what he needed. The Flame Knife bounced off the tooth, hurtled\ndownward, and thrust itself into the ground. There, as it happened, grew a\nmushroom with certain special qualities. A kind that spat out lethal poison\nwhen exposed to heat. One that was fully mature, ripe, and packed with\nspores. The firespore exploded in all directions around it, triggering cascading\nexplosions across the area. The blade tiger was right in the thick of it, with\nno escape, its body exposed to every one of the searing spores.

That’ll learn\nme!”\nThe guards could handle a blade tiger this injured well enough. Soon, it\nwas all over. Gobta was victorious. It was now time for them to take their own paths—Gobta deeper into the\nwood, the caravan back along the river to the demon lord’s lands. “I broke my treasure in the battle,” Gobta whined, “and I’ll have to pull\nthat wagon all the way back home, too…” The smile on his face, however,\nindicated he wasn’t especially torn up over it. “Well, thanks to that, you saved us all,” the head merchant said. “We\nreally need to thank you again.”\nGobta grinned sheepishly at them. “You know,” the goblina guard stammered, “I—I think I could—”\n“I’m gonna get stronger, miss! I’m gonna beat another magical beast just\nlike that—all by myself! So I can save your life sometime!”\n“Huh? Um… Yeah.\n\nYeah, exactly. Keep it up!”\nGobta had stopped her before she could finish the sentence. Which was\nprobably a good thing. It likely gave Gobta all the encouragement he\nneeded to keep striving for loftier heights, besides. Thus the two of them parted ways. Gobta’s love would have to remain\nunrequited, maybe for his whole life. Pulling the wagon behind him, Gobta walked deeper into the forest. The\nguards and merchants watched as he did. “You know,” the female guard whispered to herself, “I wouldn’t mind\nbearing children, if they were his.”\n“Not too late, miss!” one of her friends said with a laugh. “No, it’s fine.\n\nHe’s probably different from the likes of us anyway.

First of all, I’d like to thank you for picking up this\nbook. This volume is a heavily revised, rewritten, and expanded version of a\nstory originally released on the web. This work, as I’m sure some of you\nknow, is still being released on syosetu.com, a Japanese-language website\nfor online novelists and storytellers. The side story and other extra material\nin this particular book are all original to this volume, crafted for followers\nof the web version to enjoy. If this is a completely new tale to you, I’d like to suggest that you check\nout the web version as well. The main plot is the same between both\nversions, but you’ll also find a fair number of differences here and there, so\nI imagine it could be fun to compare the two for yourself. This is the first time I’ve ever written an afterword, and figuring out\nwhat I should write in it has made me slightly nervous. As a result, I\nsuppose I should write a word or two of thanks to the original forces that\nbrought this book to life. First, thanks go out as always to the people that read and supported this\nstory on the web. Your reviews and thoughts gave me a great deal of\nstrength. Thank you, Mitz Vah, who provided the wonderful illustrations for this\nbook and gave so much life and motion to all the story’s many characters. I’m sure I’ll be making lots more selfish requests to you going forward, but\nI hope you’ll be willing to put up with it. Thank you, Mr. I, the editor who first approached me about making a\nprint edition. If it weren’t for his passion, this volume never would’ve been\nreleased.\n\nFinally, thank you to everyone who purchased this book. If you read\nthrough That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and liked it, nothing could", "token_len": 539, "meta": {"block_types": "overlap,semantic", "strategy": "semantic"}}

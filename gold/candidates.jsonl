I suppose, with your sentience, you were never destined to be\nmerely a slime. Named monsters are those who have been assigned an\nexclusive name. But only ninety days? Ridiculous. Are you a unique, then?\n“Unique” meaning…?\nA unique monster is an individual who has suddenly attained unusual\nabilities, akin to mutation. They are occasionally born in areas with high\nmagical concentrations… Perhaps you were born from the mass of\nmagicules that leaked out from me, then?\nMuh? What the heck?\nLet’s try using my previous-world knowledge to suss this out. This guy\n(I’ll call him a guy for convenience’s sake) had been leaking magic all over\nthe local area. It was so thick, in fact, that it gave birth to a monster. A\nslime. Me. Was that it?\nHmm. No monster has ever come close to approaching my domain in the\npast three hundred years. If you were born from my magical force, then\nperhaps, indeed, that gave you the power to touch me and live to tell the\ntale!\nOh… So you’re kind of, like, my dad, then?\nNo, not your parent by blood. I have no reproductive ability to speak of.\nSome monsters do, and some do not, you see.\nReally? ’Cause I thought that kind of came with the package by default.\nBut if I just spontaneously burst out from magic or whatever, maybe you\ndon’t need it, huh?\n…Your intellectual abilities surprise me. Very few, indeed, are the\nmonsters that possess anything of the sort. Among all the monsters, only\nmagic-born have sentience in the way you or I would understand it.\nThe commentary went on for a while.

No wonder he couldn’t stop talking to me—I must’ve\nbeen his first conversational partner in ages.\nIf I’d had my druthers, I would have said this dragon was a total\npushover. He might’ve been feeding me a line this whole time, even, saying\nhe was a dragon. Maybe the dragons in this world weren’t even all that\npowerful in the first place.\nHeh. This was a pretty good deal.\nIs that really all you need?\nYes. To be honest with you, I was sealed away in here three hundred\nyears ago. Ever since then, I have had so much free time on my hands, I\nwas practically out of my mind with boredom. What do you think?\nWell, if that’s all you need, you got yourself a deal!\nGood. It is a promise, then…and I trust you will hold up your end of the\nbargain.\nOf course! Maybe I don’t look it, but you can count on me, man! Just ask\nanybody on Earth! They’ll vouch for me!\nHopefully he wouldn’t try to. That would be bad.\nVery well. There is a skill known as Magic Sense. Can you use it?\nOh, here we go again. More walls for me to deal with. So unfair.\nNo, I can’t. What kind of skill is that?\nIt allows you to perceive the particles of magic floating around you. It is\nnot a very powerful skill, and all it offers is a visual reference, so it is not\ndifficult to acquire.\nOh… Sounds easy enough.\nIndeed. I can wield it as easily as I can breathe. I hardly even bother to\nthink about it.\nReally? So once I learn that, I’ll be able to see again?\nPrecisely. This world is covered in sheer magic, although it is not spread\nevenly across its entire surface. Did you know, also, that light and sound\nboth have the properties of a wave?\nYeah, I’ve heard about that. Light waves and sound waves.\nAh. How intelligent of you. Did you learn of that in your past world?\nYou must have, I wager.

Extra skills “Control Flame” and “Cancel Flame Attack”…\nsuccessfully acquired.\nThen my wish came true.\nJust…not exactly the way I’d hoped for.\nWhen I next awoke, I was inside the lair of a monster, a lone man in\nfront of me. He had blue eyes, long blond hair, a well-defined face, and\nlong, slitted eyes. His skin was so pale, I thought I could almost see through\nit. His sheer beauty would make nearly anyone mistake him for a woman.\nHis name was Leon Cromwell—one of the most powerful figures of this\nworld, a so-called demon lord ascended from the human race. Also known\nas the “Platinum Devil.” He sized me up.\n“…Another failure,” he whispered, seemingly disappointed at the sight\nof me, and he showed no further interest in me after that.\nPerhaps that was why he never bothered killing me, not even with the\nserious burns I had all over my body. I was close to death, and I didn’t even\nmatter to him. Just a frail little girl clinging to life and no doubt dying soon\nenough if left alone.\nI couldn’t stand that thought. I was still alive. I didn’t want to be\nabandoned. And I never forgot that experience. That moment of frustrated\ndesperation as he sized me up and tossed me away.

Then, slowly but surely, they would\nhunt the monsters around the area, expanding their territory until they ruled\nthe woods. Soon, when the time was right, they would turn their eyes\ntoward the south, invading it for the power it held.\nThey had the strength to make it happen. Their claws could rend the\nflesh of any monster; their fangs could pierce any armor.\n“Awooooooooooo!”\nThe alpha gave the signal.\nIt was time to let the carnage begin.\nThere was, however, one concern.\nThe alpha had sent a scout a few days ago who had come back with\nsome perplexing news—news of a small monster that let off a strange,\nmystical force. Enough to surpass that of even their alpha.\nHe had shrugged off this report at first. It was too preposterous to\nentertain. He himself had detected nothing of the sort in the forest. Every\nmonster they’d encountered was a comparative weakling. Up to this point,\nnothing even resembling resistance to their advance had appeared—and\nthey were almost in the dead center of the wood. A dozen or so goblins had\npicked off one or two members of their pack, but nothing else.\nThe scout must have been too excited about the upcoming hunt to think\nstraight. That was the alpha’s conclusion as he kept his eyes forward.\nAhead lay a village. It was situated exactly where the scout said it was.\nHe had followed the trail of a wounded goblin straight to it.

We had to go with what we had,\nso that was what I did—without a moment’s pause, I had them tear down\ntheir homes and use the wood and other components to fortify the whole\ncommunity.\nIn the meantime, I ordered the goblins who were decent with a bow to\ngo on scout duty. I warned them not to wander too far afield—wolves were\nbound to have good noses. I could tell by their eyes that they were willing\nto sacrifice themselves for the cause. They were ready to shout out “By my\nvery life!” at any moment. A lot more bravado than I really needed right\nnow, but I doubted there was any quick fix for it.\nAs night fell, around a day after I arrived at the village, the final planks\nwere on the fence. The finishing touches were mine—spider silk to\nstrengthen and solidify the paling and a few Steel Thread traps here and\nthere. Anyone touching the fence without knowing the secret would be\ncarved up before they knew what hit them. I’ll have to remember to go fetch\na body or two later.\nI made sure the fence had a single entryway on one side. Once it was\nlined with Sticky Thread, my job here was done. All that remained was to\nwait for the scouts to come back.\nBy this time, the wounded goblins were starting to wake up, healed from\ntheir wounds. They furtively poked their bodies, staring curiously down at\nthemselves. Looks like that stuff packs a wallop.

After a while, I was\nable to move around somewhat under my own volition. I was perfectly at\nease with my symbiosis with Ifrit.\nThe demon lord Leon’s castle included a training facility.\nThere, the black knight served as an instructor, providing guidance for\nthe titan and nonhuman children there—although there were some adults as\nwell. It was a grueling process, and those who failed to keep up would often\nfind themselves with nothing to eat. We all struggled to keep up, with\neverything we had.\nIt was there that I learned how to fight with a sword, without borrowing\nIfrit’s power. I didn’t want to lose out to any of my fellow students, and I\nhated being treated like someone special.

They paid us with tools and such, but the merchants helped\nme carry them back, thankfully! None of the monsters around the village\ncould use that magical gear anyway…”\nAha. So they sold the weapons and stuff they found off passing\nadventurers? No wonder there was nothing decent left at the village. He\nmust’ve carted it all to the Dwarven Kingdom because the kobolds didn’t\nhave any way of appraising it on-site. Of course, any adventurers who’d\nlose to a bunch of goblins almost certainly must’ve been utter beginners, so\ninexperienced that they couldn’t even use a compass to keep from\nstumbling into monster villages.

Thanks\nfor getting these guys out of a bad way yesterday.”\n“Oh, no, it was nothing… Okay, it was something, but, ah, you know.\nHa-ha-ha-ha!”\nIt should be against the law to compliment me.

I probably wouldn’t be coming\nback down for a while.\n“So,” the old guy said, rearing back a bit, “what brings you here today?”\nI decided to go into full detail. We all piled into seats situated deeper\ninside, and Kaido was kind enough to provide a quick recap for me. I added\na few choice details, and things moved along at a good pace.\nThat younger one, though… Mildo, was it? I wish he’d say something.\nLike, how’s he managed to stay in conversations by saying nothing at all? It\nfloored me.\n“All right,” the old guy answered. “I understand. But what do you want?\nI can’t do anything for you. I’ve got a job from a certain country I gotta deal\nwith, too. None of this leaves the room, but…”\nThen it was his turn to talk, deliberately leaving out some of the finer\ndetails, as it was all classified. Basically, a number of countries were\nsending out orders for weapons and armor, spooked that a certain “idiot\nnation” might be trying to hatch a war on them all. It connected to why the\nguard was out of medicine yesterday, as well as the lack of raw materials\nplaguing the shops.\n“So,” he continued, tapping at his head, “I managed to pull an all-nighter\nto get an order for two hundred steel spears squared away…but I gotta\ncome up with twenty swords, too, and I ain’t even got one yet. There’s just\nno material!”\n“Why don’t you just say you can’t fill the order?” Kaido asked.\n“Fool! You think I didn’t, at first? But that damned minister Vester told\nme, ‘So you’re saying the great Kaijin, renowned across the entire\nkingdom, can’t even fill a simple order like this one?

That was what made me so curious\nabout the kind of sword he’d make.\nTen hours later, he was finished.\nIt looked, to me, like a plain old longsword. And—whoa, that was a lot\nof magisteel left. And here I was worried whether a fist-sized lump would\nbe enough for even one. Turned out Kaijin couldn’t even guess how much\nit’d cost to use 100 percent magisteel on everything. I suppose not. No\nwonder nobody’s come up with a flame sword or a blizzard sword or even a\nthunder sword. It’d cost too much. Makes sense.\nInstead, magisteel formed only the core of the weapon, and the rest of\nthe blade was crafted from regular steel instead. That core was all it needed\nfor its magic to work its way into the steel, eventually merging itself with\nthe whole sword. That, he said, was why a weapon grew stronger as it was\nused over time. The blade would never rust or lose its shape—it could just\nuse ambient magicules to regenerate itself.\nOddly enough, though, even these magic swords had their life spans. If\nthey were bent too far or otherwise warped beyond recognition, the magic\nwould leak out, leading to rapid weathering.\nKaijin showed me his freshly forged sword as he spoke. It was all so\ninteresting to me. I took the weapon in hand as I marveled over it—all right,\nnot in hand, but close enough. It was simple in make, straight as an arrow.\nNo bells or whistles. It wasn’t meant strictly for slicing like a katana, but\nthe blade seemed suited to slashing.\nBut this was just a base. Over time, I supposed, the sword would adapt\nitself to whatever its user wanted from it. No wonder the forger kept things\nsimple.\nOkay.\nSo Kaijin and his team had crafted this lovely sword for me, as\npromised. Now it was my turn.\n“Right!” I said. “Time for me to pull a little secret work for you. I’m\nsorry, but would you all mind leaving me alone here for now?”\nThere was no way I could let them see this. It would be too hard to\nexplain, for one thing.\n“Well, you have everything you need here, I suppose. But are you sure?\nI would be glad to help.”\n“I’ll be fine, thank you!

As head of the engineering corps,\nKaijin wound up taking the heat for it, resigning from his position in the\narmy. Not only did Vester make Kaijin the scapegoat; he even convinced his\nfriends among the higher-ranked leaders to give false testimony against\nhim. That, according to Kaijin at least, was the truth.\nOnce he finished, Kaijin let out a tired sigh.\nI could understand his perspective. There must’ve been a lot of\nresentment built up over the years from that.\nStill…man, Vester’s just a total storybook villain, isn’t he? They don’t\ncome easier to spot than that. As far as the minister was concerned, Kaijin\ncould make a comeback in the military and threaten his position at any\ntime. That kind of thing.\nDidn’t he deserve the death penalty, really? Maybe not, but…\n“So,” Kaijin concluded, “maybe he’ll settle down a bit if I leave the\ncountry for a while.”\nHe sounded a bit forlorn about it, but at least he had backup. The three\nbrothers with us were just as aware of the truth, and there was no love lost\nfor Vester among them, either. Hell, even I hated him now.\nStill, Kaijin did sock a noble, so I kind of wondered whether they were\njust gonna release us and wave good-bye.\n“I wouldn’t worry about it,” Kaijin reassured me. “I’m out of the army\nnow, but I did make it up to the corps leader. As far as my social position\ngoes, I’m just below baron. If it were strictly commoner versus nobleman in\nthe courts, well, hanging might’ve entered the picture.”\nHe accentuated that morbid fact with a hearty laugh.\nMeanwhile, I just sat there. If things got rough, I’d hightail it outta here\n—but otherwise, I was happy being a good little slime until cooler heads\nprevailed.\nOur day in court arrived soon after, and the entire lot of us were brought in\nfront of the monarch.\nThe Heroic King of the dwarves.", "wh_type": "aux", "slots": {"doc_name": "a0450f8cb93a", "doc_id": "a0450f8cb93a", "heading": "army.

No\ndoubt it was the power of the wielder more than her sword itself.\nThanks to the training I took under the demon lord’s trusted black\nknight, I had gained some mastery of swordsmanship. It was nothing Ifrit\never learned. I remembered how the knight praised me, told me it was all\nmy own talent at work.\nAs a magic-born, I was physically strong enough to be in the upper\nranks of Leon’s guard. Plus, I had mastered sword skills under the black\nknight’s guidance. It was far more than Ifrit’s power that made me such a\nclose confidant of the demon lord.\nAnd yet—nothing I did affected the hero. The strikes and slashes I had\nworked so endlessly to perfect were all effortlessly parried away. Gently\nturned aside before our blades could even clash in earnest.\nEven when Ifrit’s searing flames enveloped my entire body, the hero\nremained calm, shedding not a single drop of sweat. Just as I’d first\nthought, she was on a completely different plane of existence.\nThen I felt Ifrit falling asleep in my body, a side effect of consuming too\nmany magicules.

Then I told her about how I was summoned to this world, how I had\nlived up to now… What I had done.\nIt was selfish of me. I was a magic-born now. I had no right, no\nexpectation, to be believed at all. But it was true—having someone take an\ninterest in me and listen to my story made me happy. It left incontrovertible\nevidence that I had been alive all this time. I could throw out my chest and\nproclaim to the world that I had lived, even if it was just in someone’s\nmemory.

There was no concept of gaining\nknowledge and imparting it to the next generation, nor any habit of\nstockpiling resources to improve their living conditions.\nThis was exactly why the goblins saw no use for magical items apart\nfrom selling them in exchange for their daily needs, along with any decent\narmor they could get their grubby paws on.\nThe lack of intelligence among even the elders meant that they truly had\nno idea what a journey to the Dwarven Kingdom would entail. The roundtrip would take several months—a hefty part of a goblin’s life span—and he\nwould have to risk everything he held dear. Yet nobody in the goblin village\nconsidered it to be a terribly important mission. To the elders and other\nmature adults, they were simply taking a rough-sounding assignment and\ngiving it to a child with nothing better to do. They held no ill will toward\nhim—nor, really, the arithmetic skills needed to appreciate the scope of this\nquest. It was just how it was.\nAnd so, with only a few moments of hesitation, Gobta’s journey to the\nDwarven Kingdom was set in stone.\nWhy is everyone so mean? Gobta whined to himself.\nHe had a valid point. He was a goblin child, still not fully grown, and\nthey were strapping a load the size of a mountain on his back and sending\nhim off on some grand quest. He had heard from the kobolds that it’d be a\ntwo-month walk by itself, but with all this baggage? It was hard even\nputting one foot in front of the other.\nBut no point complaining about it. Gobta started to think. Then he had\nan idea.\nWhy don’t I put all this junk in a box and pull it behind me?\nThis, unfortunately, didn’t work. The box refused to move. Gobta\nscratched his head some more. Then he remembered the really big box he\nsaw once, near a human settlement, with a horse pulling it around.\nOh yeah, that one had some round things on it, didn’t it…?\nWhat he was remembering was a cart, and the “round things” were\nwheels, although he didn’t have the words for them in his vocabulary. So\nGobta foraged around for something that would work in their place.

He sat there the entire day, just watching it go\nby, until night fell.\nThe next morning, fully satisfied at the view he had taken in, Gobta set\noff early. Only when he was about to start walking did he notice an\nimportant issue.\n“Huh? They said to follow my left hand once I reached the river,” he\nwhispered, not expecting an answer. “But if I turn around, it’s going in the\nopposite direction…?”\nHe was right. He knew he had put a mark on his left hand so he’d\nremember which one it was when it came time to tackle that important\nissue. The only problem: It turned out his left hand would point in different\ndirections whenever he moved. Follow his left hand where? That was the\nhard part.\nIn the end, he decided to pick up a tree branch he found at the side of the\nriver, let it fall to the ground, and travel the way it pointed. The fact that it\nwound up facing the correct way was another testament to Gobta’s\nastounding luck. He followed the branch’s lead, not doubting it for a\nmoment, and the trip went problem-free from there.\nJust when the journey was starting to bore him a little with its simplicity,\nGobta saw some shallows in the river up ahead. It was a watering hole for\nthe forest animals nearby, although none of them seemed to be fighting each\nother. They were avoiding confrontation at this spot—a sort of instinctual,\nunwritten law of nature, perhaps. Carnivore and herbivore were here\ntogether, one of the few places in the wild world where you’d ever see it.\nThat rule, however, was reserved for the animal kingdom.

Gobta wasn’t very smart, but he was smart\nenough to take advantage of the situation.\nWhoa! I don’t know what happened, but this is my big chance!\nA greater adventurer would have closed in to stab the final blow. Not\nGobta. Quickly, he planned his escape, making sure to pick up his hare\nbefore he left.\nReaching his battered old wagon, he tossed the bunny corpse on top of\nthe load and ran away at full speed. He kept going as long as his breath\nwould let him, until he finally made it to what seemed to be a safe place.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief, having escaped what had been the greatest\ndanger ever to occur in his life.\nBeing freed from certain death immediately reminded Gobta that he was\nhungry. He recalled the hare in his possession, but not even he was simple\nenough to let his guard down here. He decided to move over to the riverbed,\nwhich would give him a good view of his entire surroundings, and used\nsome stones and dead sticks to fashion a serviceable outdoor stove.\nThe danger of the past few moments was now firmly behind him as\nGobta’s thoughts turned to his appetite. He drained the carcass of blood,\nbristling with anticipation, and skinned and gutted the animal.\nBefore long, it was arranged on a stick atop the fire. Now all he had to\ndo was rotate the stick around and make sure the surface was fully cooked.\nIt was a simple recipe, combined with some berry juice squeezed over the\ncarcass, and it took only a few moments to wrap up.\n“This is great! This is so great!”\nGobta chewed on the meat, not minding the oils dripping down on him.\nThere was nothing more delicious than the first meal after staring death in\nthe face.

Gobta wasn’t very smart, but he was smart\nenough to take advantage of the situation.\nWhoa! I don’t know what happened, but this is my big chance!\nA greater adventurer would have closed in to stab the final blow. Not\nGobta. Quickly, he planned his escape, making sure to pick up his hare\nbefore he left.\nReaching his battered old wagon, he tossed the bunny corpse on top of\nthe load and ran away at full speed. He kept going as long as his breath\nwould let him, until he finally made it to what seemed to be a safe place.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief, having escaped what had been the greatest\ndanger ever to occur in his life.\nBeing freed from certain death immediately reminded Gobta that he was\nhungry. He recalled the hare in his possession, but not even he was simple\nenough to let his guard down here. He decided to move over to the riverbed,\nwhich would give him a good view of his entire surroundings, and used\nsome stones and dead sticks to fashion a serviceable outdoor stove.\nThe danger of the past few moments was now firmly behind him as\nGobta’s thoughts turned to his appetite. He drained the carcass of blood,\nbristling with anticipation, and skinned and gutted the animal.\nBefore long, it was arranged on a stick atop the fire. Now all he had to\ndo was rotate the stick around and make sure the surface was fully cooked.\nIt was a simple recipe, combined with some berry juice squeezed over the\ncarcass, and it took only a few moments to wrap up.\n“This is great!
